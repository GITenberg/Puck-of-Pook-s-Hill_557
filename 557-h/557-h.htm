The children were at the Theatre, acting to Three Cows as much as they
could remember of Midsummer Night's Dream.  Their father had made them
a small play out of the big Shakespeare one, and they had rehearsed it
with him and with their mother till they could say it by heart.  They
began when Nick Bottom the weaver comes out of the bushes with a
donkey's head on his shoulders, and finds Titania, Queen of the
Fairies, asleep.  Then they skipped to the part where Bottom asks three
little fairies to scratch his head and bring him honey, and they ended
where he falls asleep in Titania's arms.  Dan was Puck and Nick Bottom,
as well as all three Fairies.  He wore a pointy-cloth cap for Puck, and
a paper donkey's head out of a Christmas cracker&mdash;but it tore if you
were not careful&mdash;for Bottom.  Una was Titania, with a wreath of
columbines and a foxglove wand.
</P>

<P>
The Theatre lay in a meadow called the Long Slip.  A little
mill-stream, carrying water to a mill two or three fields away, bent
round one corner of it, and in the middle of the bend lay a large old
Fairy Ring of darkened grass, which was the stage.  The millstream
banks, overgrown with willow, hazel, and guelder-rose, made convenient
places to wait in till your turn came; and a grown-up who had seen it
said that Shakespeare himself could not have imagined a more suitable
setting for his play.  They were not, of course, allowed to act on
Midsummer Night itself, but they went down after tea on Midsummer Eve,
when the shadows were growing, and they took their supper&mdash;hard-boiled
eggs, Bath Oliver biscuits, and salt in an envelope&mdash;with them.  Three
Cows had been milked and were grazing steadily with a tearing noise
that one could hear all down the meadow; and the noise of the Mill at
work sounded like bare feet running on hard ground.  A cuckoo sat on a
gate-post singing his broken June tune, 'cuckoo-cuck', while a busy
kingfisher crossed from the mill-stream, to the brook which ran on the
other side of the meadow.  Everything else was a sort of thick, sleepy
stillness smelling of meadow-sweet and dry grass.
</P>

<P>
Their play went beautifully.  Dan remembered all his parts&mdash;Puck,
Bottom, and the three Fairies&mdash;and Una never forgot a word of
Titania&mdash;not even the difficult piece where she tells the Fairies how
to feed Bottom with 'apricocks, green figs, and dewberries', and all
the lines end in 'ies'.  They were both so pleased that they acted it
three times over from beginning to end before they sat down in the
unthistly centre of the Ring to eat eggs and Bath Olivers.  This was
when they heard a whistle among the alders on the bank, and they jumped.
</P>

<P>
The bushes parted.  In the very spot where Dan had stood as Puck they
saw a small, brown, broad-shouldered, pointy-eared person with a snub
nose, slanting blue eyes, and a grin that ran right across his freckled
face.  He shaded his forehead as though he were watching Quince, Snout,
Bottom, and the others rehearsing Pyramus and Thisbe, and, in a voice
as deep as Three Cows asking to be milked, he began:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,<BR>
     So near the cradle of the fairy Queen?'<BR>
</P>

<P>
He stopped, hollowed one hand round his ear, and, with a wicked twinkle
in his eye, went on:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'What, a play toward?  I'll be an auditor;<BR>
     An actor, too, perhaps, if I see cause.'<BR>
</P>

<P>
The children looked and gasped.  The small thing&mdash;he was no taller than
Dan's shoulder&mdash;stepped quietly into the Ring.
</P>

<P>
'I'm rather out of practice,' said he; 'but that's the way my part
ought to be played.'
</P>

<P>
Still the children stared at him&mdash;from his dark-blue cap, like a big
columbine flower, to his bare, hairy feet.  At last he laughed.
</P>

<P>
'Please don't look like that.  It isn't my fault.  What else could you
expect?' he said.
</P>

<P>
'We didn't expect any one,' Dan answered slowly. 'This is our field.'
</P>

<P>
'Is it?' said their visitor, sitting down.  'Then what on Human Earth
made you act Midsummer Night's Dream three times over, on Midsummer
Eve, in the middle of a Ring, and under&mdash;right under one of my oldest
hills in Old England?  Pook's Hill&mdash;Puck's Hill&mdash;Puck's Hill&mdash;Pook's
Hill!  It's as plain as the nose on my face.'
</P>

<P>
He pointed to the bare, fern-covered slope of Pook's Hill that runs up
from the far side of the mill-stream to a dark wood.  Beyond that wood
the ground rises and rises for five hundred feet, till at last you
climb out on the bare top of Beacon Hill, to look over the Pevensey
Levels and the Channel and half the naked South Downs.
</P>

<P>
'By Oak, Ash, and Thorn!' he cried, still laughing.  'If this had
happened a few hundred years ago you'd have had all the People of the
Hills out like bees in June!'
</P>

<P>
'We didn't know it was wrong,' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Wrong!'  The little fellow shook with laughter.  'Indeed, it isn't
wrong.  You've done something that Kings and Knights and Scholars in
old days would have given their crowns and spurs and books to find out.
If Merlin himself had helped you, you couldn't have managed better!
You've broken the Hills&mdash;you've broken the Hills! It hasn't happened in
a thousand years.'
</P>

<P>
'We&mdash;we didn't mean to,' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Of course you didn't!  That's just why you did it. Unluckily the Hills
are empty now, and all the People of the Hills are gone.  I'm the only
one left.  I'm Puck, the oldest Old Thing in England, very much at your
service if&mdash;if you care to have anything to do with me.  If you don't,
of course you've only to say so, and I'll go.'
</P>

<P>
He looked at the children, and the children looked at him for quite
half a minute.  His eyes did not twinkle any more.  They were very
kind, and there was the beginning of a good smile on his lips.
</P>

<P>
Una put out her hand.  'Don't go,' she said.  'We like you.' 'Have a
Bath Oliver,' said Dan, and he passed over the squashy envelope with
the eggs.
</P>

<P>
'By Oak, Ash and Thorn,' cried Puck, taking off his blue cap, 'I like
you too.  Sprinkle a plenty salt on the biscuit, Dan, and I'll eat it
with you.  That'll show you the sort of person I am.  Some of us'&mdash;he
went on, with his mouth full&mdash;'couldn't abide Salt, or Horse-shoes over
a door, or Mountain-ash berries, or Running Water, or Cold Iron, or the
sound of Church Bells.  But I'm Puck!'
</P>

<P>
He brushed the crumbs carefully from his doublet and shook hands.
</P>

<P>
'We always said, Dan and I,' Una stammered, 'that if it ever happened
we'd know ex-actly what to do; but&mdash;but now it seems all different
somehow.'
</P>

<P>
'She means meeting a fairy,'said Dan.  'I never believed in 'em&mdash;not
after I was six, anyhow.'
</P>

<P>
'I did,' said Una.  'At least, I sort of half believed till we learned
"Farewell, Rewards".  Do you know "Farewell, Rewards and Fairies"?'
</P>

<P>
'Do you mean this?' said Puck.  He threw his big head back and began at
the second line:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'Good housewives now may say,<BR>
     For now foul sluts in dairies<BR>
     Do fare as well as they;<BR>
     And though they sweep their hearths no less<BR>
</P>

<P>
('Join in, Una!')
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     Than maids were wont to do,<BR>
     Yet who of late for cleanliness<BR>
     Finds sixpence in her shoe?'<BR>
</P>

<P>
The echoes flapped all along the flat meadow. 'Of course I know it,' he
said.
</P>

<P>
'And then there's the verse about the rings,' said Dan. 'When I was
little it always made me feel unhappy in my inside.'
</P>

<P>
"'Witness those rings and roundelays", do you mean?' boomed Puck, with
a voice like a great church organ.
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'Of theirs which yet remain,<BR>
     Were footed in Queen Mary's days<BR>
     On many a grassy plain,<BR>
     But since of late Elizabeth,<BR>
     And, later, James came in,<BR>
     Are never seen on any heath<BR>
     As when the time hath been.<BR>
</P>

<P>
'It's some time since I heard that sung, but there's no good beating
about the bush:  it's true.  The People of the Hills have all left.  I
saw them come into Old England and I saw them go.  Giants, trolls,
kelpies, brownies, goblins, imps; wood, tree, mound, and water spirits;
heath-people, hill-watchers, treasure-guards, good people, little
people, pishogues, leprechauns, night-riders, pixies, nixies, gnomes,
and the rest&mdash;gone, all gone!  I came into England with Oak, Ash and
Thorn, and when Oak, Ash and Thorn are gone I shall go too.'
</P>

<P>
Dan looked round the meadow&mdash;at Una's Oak by the lower gate; at the
line of ash trees that overhang Otter Pool where the millstream spills
over when the Mill does not need it, and at the gnarled old white-thorn
where Three Cows scratched their necks.
</P>

<P>
'It's all right,' he said; and added, 'I'm planting a lot of acorns
this autumn too.'
</P>

<P>
'Then aren't you most awfully old?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Not old&mdash;fairly long-lived, as folk say hereabouts.  Let me see&mdash;my
friends used to set my dish of cream for me o' nights when Stonehenge
was new.  Yes, before the Flint Men made the Dewpond under Chanctonbury
Ring.' Una clasped her hands, cried 'Oh!' and nodded her head.
</P>

<P>
'She's thought a plan,' Dan explained.  'She always does like that when
she thinks a plan.'
</P>

<P>
'I was thinking&mdash;suppose we saved some of our porridge and put it in
the attic for you?  They'd notice if we left it in the nursery.'
</P>

<P>
'Schoolroom,' said Dan quickly, and Una flushed, because they had made
a solemn treaty that summer not to call the schoolroom the nursery any
more.
</P>

<P>
'Bless your heart o' gold!' said Puck.  'You'll make a fine considering
wench some market-day.  I really don't want you to put out a bowl for
me; but if ever I need a bite, be sure I'll tell you.'
</P>

<P>
He stretched himself at length on the dry grass, and the children
stretched out beside him, their bare legs waving happily in the air.
They felt they could not be afraid of him any more than of their
particular friend old Hobden the hedger.  He did not bother them with
grown-up questions, or laugh at the donkey's head, but lay and smiled
to himself in the most sensible way. 'Have you a knife on you?' he said
at last.
</P>

<P>
Dan handed over his big one-bladed outdoor knife, and Puck began to
carve out a piece of turf from the centre of the Ring.
</P>

<P>
'What's that for&mdash;Magic?' said Una, as he pressed up the square of
chocolate loam that cut like so much cheese.
</P>

<P>
'One of my little magics,' he answered, and cut another.  'You see, I
can't let you into the Hills because the People of the Hills have gone;
but if you care to take seisin from me, I may be able to show you
something out of the common here on Human Earth.  You certainly deserve
it.'
</P>

<P>
'What's taking seisin?' said Dan, cautiously.
</P>

<P>
'It's an old custom the people had when they bought and sold land.
They used to cut out a clod and hand it over to the buyer, and you
weren't lawfully seised of your land&mdash;it didn't really belong to
you&mdash;till the other fellow had actually given you a piece of it&mdash;'like
this.'  He held out the turves.
</P>

<P>
'But it's our own meadow,' said Dan, drawing back. 'Are you going to
magic it away?'
</P>

<P>
Puck laughed.  'I know it's your meadow, but there's a great deal more
in it than you or your father ever guessed.  Try!'
</P>

<P>
He turned his eyes on Una.
</P>

<P>
'I'll do it,' she said.  Dan followed her example at once.
</P>

<P>
'Now are you two lawfully seised and possessed of all Old England,'
began Puck, in a sing-song voice.  'By right of Oak, Ash, and Thorn are
you free to come and go and look and know where I shall show or best
you please. You shall see What you shall see and you shall hear What
you shall hear, though It shall have happened three thousand year; and
you shall know neither Doubt nor Fear.  Fast!  Hold fast all I give
you.'
</P>

<P>
The children shut their eyes, but nothing happened.
</P>

<P>
'Well?' said Una, disappointedly opening them.  'I thought there would
be dragons.'
</P>

<P>
"'Though It shall have happened three thousand year,"' said Puck, and
counted on his fingers.  'No; I'm afraid there were no dragons three
thousand years ago.'
</P>

<P>
'But there hasn't happened anything at all,' said Dan. 'Wait awhile,'
said Puck.  'You don't grow an oak in a year&mdash;and Old England's older
than twenty oaks.  Let's sit down again and think.  I can do that for a
century at a time.'
</P>

<P>
'Ah, but you're a fairy,' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Have you ever heard me say that word yet?' said Puck quickly.
</P>

<P>
'No.  You talk about "the People of the Hills", but you never say
"fairies",' said Una.  'I was wondering at that. Don't you like it?'
</P>

<P>
'How would you like to be called "mortal" or "human being" all the
time?' said Puck; 'or "son of Adam" or "daughter of Eve"?'
</P>

<P>
'I shouldn't like it at all,' said Dan.  'That's how the Djinns and
Afrits talk in the Arabian Nights.'
</P>

<P>
'And that's how I feel about saying&mdash;that word that I don't say.
Besides, what you call them are made-up things the People of the Hills
have never heard of&mdash;little buzzflies with butterfly wings and gauze
petticoats, and shiny stars in their hair, and a wand like a
schoolteacher's cane for punishing bad boys and rewarding good ones.  I
know 'em!'
</P>

<P>
'We don't mean that sort,'said Dan.  'We hate 'em too.'
</P>

<P>
'Exactly,' said Puck.  'Can you wonder that the People of the Hills
don't care to be confused with that painty-winged, wand-waving,
sugar-and-shake-your-head set of impostors?  Butterfly wings, indeed!
I've seen Sir Huon and a troop of his people setting off from Tintagel
Castle for Hy-Brasil in the teeth of a sou'-westerly gale, with the
spray flying all over the Castle, and the Horses of the Hills wild with
fright.  Out they'd go in a lull, screaming like gulls, and back they'd
be driven five good miles inland before they could come head to wind
again. Butterfly-wings!  It was Magic&mdash;Magic as black as Merlin could
make it, and the whole sea was green fire and white foam with singing
mermaids in it.  And the Horses of the Hills picked their way from one
wave to another by the lightning flashes!  That was how it was in the
old days!'
</P>

<P>
'Splendid,' said Dan, but Una shuddered.
</P>

<P>
'I'm glad they're gone, then; but what made the People of the Hills go
away?' Una asked.
</P>

<P>
'Different things.  I'll tell you one of them some day&mdash;the thing that
made the biggest flit of any,' said Puck.  'But they didn't all flit at
once.  They dropped off, one by one, through the centuries.  Most of
them were foreigners who couldn't stand our climate.  They flitted
early.'
</P>

<P>
'How early?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'A couple of thousand years or more.  The fact is they began as Gods.
The Phoenicians brought some over when they came to buy tin; and the
Gauls, and the Jutes, and the Danes, and the Frisians, and the Angles
brought more when they landed.  They were always landing in those days,
or being driven back to their ships, and they always brought their Gods
with them.  England is a bad country for Gods.  Now, I began as I mean
to go on.  A bowl of porridge, a dish of milk, and a little quiet fun
with the country folk in the lanes was enough for me then, as it is
now.  I belong here, you see, and I have been mixed up with people all
my days.  But most of the others insisted on being Gods, and having
temples, and altars, and priests, and sacrifices of their own.'
</P>

<P>
'People burned in wicker baskets?' said Dan.  'Like Miss Blake tells us
about?'
</P>

<P>
'All sorts of sacrifices,' said Puck.  'If it wasn't men, it was
horses, or cattle, or pigs, or metheglin&mdash;that's a sticky, sweet sort
of beer.  I never liked it.  They were a stiff-necked, extravagant set
of idols, the Old Things.  But what was the result?  Men don't like
being sacrificed at the best of times; they don't even like sacrificing
their farm-horses.  After a while, men simply left the Old Things
alone, and the roofs of their temples fell in, and the Old Things had
to scuttle out and pick up a living as they could.  Some of them took
to hanging about trees, and hiding in graves and groaning o' nights.
If they groaned loud enough and long enough they might frighten a poor
countryman into sacrificing a hen, or leaving a pound of butter for
them.  I remember one Goddess called Belisama.  She became a common wet
water-spirit somewhere in Lancashire.  And there were hundreds of other
friends of mine.  First they were Gods.  Then they were People of the
Hills, and then they flitted to other places because they couldn't get
on with the English for one reason or another.  There was only one Old
Thing, I remember, who honestly worked for his living after he came
down in the world.  He was called Weland, and he was a smith to some
Gods.  I've forgotten their names, but he used to make them swords and
spears.  I think he claimed kin with Thor of the Scandinavians.'
</P>

<P>
'Heroes of Asgard Thor?' said Una.  She had been reading the book.
</P>

<P>
'Perhaps,' answered Puck.  'None the less, when bad times came, he
didn't beg or steal.  He worked; and I was lucky enough to be able to
do him a good turn.'
</P>

<P>
'Tell us about it,' said Dan.  'I think I like hearing of Old Things.'
</P>

<P>
They rearranged themselves comfortably, each chewing a grass stem.
Puck propped himself on one strong arm and went on:
</P>

<P>
'Let's think!  I met Weland first on a November afternoon in a sleet
storm, on Pevensey Level.'
</P>

<P>
'Pevensey?  Over the hill, you mean?'  Dan pointed south.
</P>

<P>
'Yes; but it was all marsh in those days, right up to Horsebridge and
Hydeneye.  I was on Beacon Hill&mdash;they called it Brunanburgh then&mdash;when
I saw the pale flame that burning thatch makes, and I went down to
look. Some pirates&mdash;I think they must have been Peor's men&mdash;were
burning a village on the Levels, and Weland's image&mdash;a big, black
wooden thing with amber beads round his neck&mdash;lay in the bows of a
black thirty-two-oar galley that they had just beached.  Bitter cold it
was!  There were icicles hanging from her deck and the oars were glazed
over with ice, and there was ice on Weland's lips. When he saw me he
began a long chant in his own tongue, telling me how he was going to
rule England, and how I should smell the smoke of his altars from
Lincolnshire to the Isle of Wight.  I didn't care!  I'd seen too many
Gods charging into Old England to be upset about it.  I let him sing
himself out while his men were burning the village, and then I said (I
don't know what put it into my head), "Smith of the Gods," I said, "the
time comes when I shall meet you plying your trade for hire by the
wayside."'
</P>

<P>
'What did Weland say?' said Una.  'Was he angry?'
</P>

<P>
'He called me names and rolled his eyes, and I went away to wake up the
people inland.  But the pirates conquered the country, and for
centuries Weland was a most important God.  He had temples
everywhere&mdash;from Lincolnshire to the Isle of Wight, as he said&mdash;and his
sacrifices were simply scandalous.  To do him justice, he preferred
horses to men; but men or horses, I knew that presently he'd have to
come down in the world&mdash;like the other Old Things.  I gave him lots of
time&mdash;I gave him about a thousand years&mdash;and at the end of 'em I went
into one of his temples near Andover to see how he prospered. There was
his altar, and there was his image, and there were his priests, and
there were the congregation, and everybody seemed quite happy, except
Weland and the priests.  In the old days the congregation were unhappy
until the priests had chosen their sacrifices; and so would you have
been.  When the service began a priest rushed out, dragged a man up to
the altar, pretended to hit him on the head with a little gilt axe, and
the man fell down and pretended to die.  Then everybody shouted: "A
sacrifice to Weland!  A sacrifice to Weland!"'
</P>

<P>
'And the man wasn't really dead?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Not a bit.  All as much pretence as a dolls' tea-party. Then they
brought out a splendid white horse, and the priest cut some hair from
its mane and tail and burned it on the altar, shouting, "A sacrifice!"
That counted the same as if a man and a horse had been killed.  I saw
poor Weland's face through the smoke, and I couldn't help laughing.  He
looked so disgusted and so hungry, and all he had to satisfy himself
was a horrid smell of burning hair.  Just a dolls' tea-party!
</P>

<P>
'I judged it better not to say anything then ('twouldn't have been
fair), and the next time I came to Andover, a few hundred years later,
Weland and his temple were gone, and there was a Christian bishop in a
church there. None of the People of the Hills could tell me anything
about him, and I supposed that he had left England.' Puck turned, lay
on his other elbow, and thought for a long time.
</P>

<P>
'Let's see,' he said at last.  'It must have been some few years
later&mdash;a year or two before the Conquest, I think&mdash;that I came back to
Pook's Hill here, and one evening I heard old Hobden talking about
Weland's Ford.'
</P>

<P>
'If you mean old Hobden the hedger, he's only seventy-two. He told me
so himself,' said Dan.  'He's a intimate friend of ours.'
</P>

<P>
'You're quite right,' Puck replied.  'I meant old Hobden's ninth
great-grandfather.  He was a free man and burned charcoal hereabouts.
I've known the family, father and son, so long that I get confused
sometimes. Hob of the Dene was my Hobden's name, and he lived at the
Forge cottage.  Of course, I pricked up my ears when I heard Weland
mentioned, and I scuttled through the woods to the Ford just beyond Bog
Wood yonder.'  He jerked his head westward, where the valley narrows
between wooded hills and steep hop-fields.
</P>

<P>
'Why, that's Willingford Bridge,' said Una.  'We go there for walks
often.  There's a kingfisher there.'
</P>

<P>
'It was Weland's Ford then, dearie.  A road led down to it from the
Beacon on the top of the hill&mdash;a shocking bad road it was&mdash;and all the
hillside was thick, thick oak-forest, with deer in it.  There was no
trace of Weland, but presently I saw a fat old farmer riding down from
the Beacon under the greenwood tree.  His horse had cast a shoe in the
clay, and when he came to the Ford he dismounted, took a penny out of
his purse, laid it on a stone, tied the old horse to an oak, and called
out: "Smith, Smith, here is work for you!" Then he sat down and went to
sleep.  You can imagine how I felt when I saw a white-bearded, bent old
blacksmith in a leather apron creep out from behind the oak and begin
to shoe the horse.  It was Weland himself.  I was so astonished that I
jumped out and said:  "What on Human Earth are you doing here, Weland?"'
</P>

<P>
'Poor Weland!' sighed Una.
</P>

<P>
'He pushed the long hair back from his forehead (he didn't recognize me
at first).  Then he said:  "You ought to know.  You foretold it, Old
Thing.  I'm shoeing horses for hire.  I'm not even Weland now," he
said.  "They call me Wayland-Smith."'
</P>

<P>
'Poor chap!' said Dan.  'What did you say?'
</P>

<P>
'What could I say?  He looked up, with the horse's foot on his lap, and
he said, smiling, "I remember the time when I wouldn't have accepted
this old bag of bones as a sacrifice, and now I'm glad enough to shoe
him for a penny."
</P>

<P>
"'Isn't there any way for you to get back to Valhalla, or wherever you
come from?" I said.
</P>

<P>
"'I'm afraid not," he said, rasping away at the hoof.  He had a
wonderful touch with horses.  The old beast was whinnying on his
shoulder.  "You may remember that I was not a gentle God in my Day and
my Time and my Power.  I shall never be released till some human being
truly wishes me well."
</P>

<P>
"'Surely," said I, "the farmer can't do less than that. You're shoeing
the horse all round for him."
</P>

<P>
"'Yes," said he, "and my nails will hold a shoe from one full moon to
the next.  But farmers and Weald clay," said he, "are both uncommon
cold and sour."
</P>

<P>
'Would you believe it, that when that farmer woke and found his horse
shod he rode away without one word of thanks?  I was so angry that I
wheeled his horse right round and walked him back three miles to the
Beacon, just to teach the old sinner politeness.'
</P>

<P>
'Were you invisible?' said Una.  Puck nodded, gravely.
</P>

<P>
'The Beacon was always laid in those days ready to light, in case the
French landed at Pevensey; and I walked the horse about and about it
that lee-long summer night. The farmer thought he was bewitched&mdash;well,
he was, of course&mdash;and began to pray and shout.  I didn't care!  I was
as good a Christian as he any fair-day in the County, and about four
o'clock in the morning a young novice came along from the monastery
that used to stand on the top of Beacon Hill.'
</P>

<P>
'What's a novice?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'It really means a man who is beginning to be a monk, but in those days
people sent their sons to a monastery just the same as a school.  This
young fellow had been to a monastery in France for a few months every
year, and he was finishing his studies in the monastery close to his
home here.  Hugh was his name, and he had got up to go fishing
hereabouts.  His people owned all this valley. Hugh heard the farmer
shouting, and asked him what in the world he meant.  The old man spun
him a wonderful tale about fairies and goblins and witches; and I know
he hadn't seen a thing except rabbits and red deer all that night.
(The People of the Hills are like otters&mdash;they don't show except when
they choose.) But the novice wasn't a fool.  He looked down at the
horse's feet, and saw the new shoes fastened as only Weland knew how to
fasten 'em.  (Weland had a way of turning down the nails that folks
called the Smith's Clinch.)
</P>

<P>
"'H'm!" said the novice.  "Where did you get your horse shod?"
</P>

<P>
'The farmer wouldn't tell him at first, because the priests never liked
their people to have any dealings with the Old Things.  At last he
confessed that the Smith had done it.  "What did you pay him?" said the
novice. "Penny," said the farmer, very sulkily.  "That's less than a
Christian would have charged," said the novice.  "I hope you threw a
'thank you' into the bargain." "No," said the farmer; "Wayland-Smith's
a heathen." "Heathen or no heathen," said the novice, "you took his
help, and where you get help there you must give thanks." "What?" said
the farmer&mdash;he was in a furious temper because I was walking the old
horse in circles all this time&mdash;"What, you young jackanapes?" said he.
"Then by your reasoning I ought to say 'Thank you' to Satan if he
helped me?"  "Don't roll about up there splitting reasons with me,"
said the novice.  "Come back to the Ford and thank the Smith, or you'll
be sorry."
</P>

<P>
'Back the farmer had to go.  I led the horse, though no one saw me, and
the novice walked beside us, his gown swishing through the shiny dew
and his fishing-rod across his shoulders, spear-wise.  When we reached
the Ford again&mdash;it was five o'clock and misty still under the oaks&mdash;the
farmer simply wouldn't say "Thank you." He said he'd tell the Abbot
that the novice wanted him to worship heathen Gods.  Then Hugh the
novice lost his temper.  He just cried, "Out!" put his arm under the
farmer's fat leg, and heaved him from his saddle on to the turf, and
before he could rise he caught him by the back of the neck and shook
him like a rat till the farmer growled, "Thank you, Wayland-Smith."'
</P>

<P>
'Did Weland see all this?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Oh yes, and he shouted his old war-cry when the farmer thudded on to
the ground.  He was delighted. Then the novice turned to the oak tree
and said, "Ho, Smith of the Gods!  I am ashamed of this rude farmer;
but for all you have done in kindness and charity to him and to others
of our people, I thank you and wish you well." Then he picked up his
fishing-rod&mdash;it looked more like a tall spear than ever&mdash;and tramped
off down your valley.'
</P>

<P>
'And what did poor Weland do?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'He laughed and he cried with joy, because he had been released at
last, and could go away.  But he was an honest Old Thing.  He had
worked for his living and he paid his debts before he left.  "I shall
give that novice a gift," said Weland.  "A gift that shall do him good
the wide world over and Old England after him.  Blow up my fire, Old
Thing, while I get the iron for my last task." Then he made a sword&mdash;a
dark-grey, wavy-lined sword&mdash;and I blew the fire while he hammered.  By
Oak, Ash and Thorn, I tell you, Weland was a Smith of the Gods!  He
cooled that sword in running water twice, and the third time he cooled
it in the evening dew, and he laid it out in the moonlight and said
Runes (that's charms) over it, and he carved Runes of Prophecy on the
blade.  "Old Thing," he said to me, wiping his forehead, "this is the
best blade that Weland ever made.  Even the user will never know how
good it is.  Come to the monastery."
</P>

<P>
'We went to the dormitory where the monks slept, we saw the novice fast
asleep in his cot, and Weland put the sword into his hand, and I
remember the young fellow gripped it in his sleep.  Then Weland strode
as far as he dared into the Chapel and threw down all his
shoeing-tools&mdash;his hammers and pincers and rasps&mdash;to show that he had
done with them for ever.  It sounded like suits of armour falling, and
the sleepy monks ran in, for they thought the monastery had been
attacked by the French. The novice came first of all, waving his new
sword and shouting Saxon battle-cries.  When they saw the shoeing-tools
they were very bewildered, till the novice asked leave to speak, and
told what he had done to the farmer, and what he had said to
Wayland-Smith, and how, though the dormitory light was burning, he had
found the wonderful Rune-carved sword in his cot.
</P>

<P>
'The Abbot shook his head at first, and then he laughed and said to the
novice:  "Son Hugh, it needed no sign from a heathen God to show me
that you will never be a monk.  Take your sword, and keep your sword,
and go with your sword, and be as gentle as you are strong and
courteous.  We will hang up the Smith's tools before the Altar," he
said, "because, whatever the Smith of the Gods may have been, in the
old days, we know that he worked honestly for his living and made gifts
to Mother Church." Then they went to bed again, all except the novice,
and he sat up in the garth playing with his sword. Then Weland said to
me by the stables:  "Farewell, Old Thing; you had the right of it.  You
saw me come to England, and you see me go.  Farewell!"
</P>

<P>
'With that he strode down the hill to the corner of the Great
Woods&mdash;Woods Corner, you call it now&mdash;to the very place where he had
first landed&mdash;and I heard him moving through the thickets towards
Horsebridge for a little, and then he was gone.  That was how it
happened.  I saw it.'
</P>

<P>
Both children drew a long breath.
</P>

<P>
'But what happened to Hugh the novice?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'And the sword?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
Puck looked down the meadow that lay all quiet and cool in the shadow
of Pook's Hill.  A corncrake jarred in a hay-field near by, and the
small trouts of the brook began to jump.  A big white moth flew
unsteadily from the alders and flapped round the children's heads, and
the least little haze of water-mist rose from the brook. 'Do you really
want to know?' Puck said.
</P>

<P>
'We do,' cried the children.  'Awfully!'
</P>

<P>
'Very good.  I promised you that you shall see What you shall see, and
you shall hear What you shall hear, though It shall have happened three
thousand year; but just now it seems to me that, unless you go back to
the house, people will be looking for you.  I'll walk with you as far
as the gate.'
</P>

<P>
'Will you be here when we come again?' they asked.
</P>

<P>
'Surely, sure-ly,' said Puck.  'I've been here some time already.  One
minute first, please.'
</P>

<P>
He gave them each three leaves&mdash;one of Oak, one of Ash and one of Thorn.
</P>

<P>
'Bite these,' said he.  'Otherwise you might be talking at home of what
you've seen and heard, and&mdash;if I know human beings&mdash;they'd send for the
doctor.  Bite!'
</P>

<P>
They bit hard, and found themselves walking side by side to the lower
gate.  Their father was leaning over it.
</P>

<P>
'And how did your play go?' he asked.
</P>

<P>
'Oh, splendidly,' said Dan.  'Only afterwards, I think, we went to
sleep.  It was very hot and quiet.  Don't you remember, Una?'
</P>

<P>
Una shook her head and said nothing.
</P>

<P>
'I see,' said her father.

YOUNG MEN AT THE MANOR
</H3>

<P>
They were fishing, a few days later, in the bed of the brook that for
centuries had cut deep into the soft valley soil.  The trees closing
overhead made long tunnels through which the sunshine worked in blobs
and patches.  Down in the tunnels were bars of sand and gravel, old
roots and trunks covered with moss or painted red by the irony water;
foxgloves growing lean and pale towards the light; clumps of fern and
thirsty shy flowers who could not live away from moisture and shade.
In the pools you could see the wave thrown up by the trouts as they
charged hither and yon, and the pools were joined to each other&mdash;except
in flood-time, when all was one brown rush&mdash;by sheets of thin broken
water that poured themselves chuckling round the darkness of the next
bend.
</P>

<P>
This was one of the children's most secret hunting-grounds, and their
particular friend, old Hobden the hedger, had shown them how to use it.
Except for the click of a rod hitting a low willow, or a switch and
tussle among the young ash leaves as a line hung up for the minute,
nobody in the hot pasture could have guessed what game was going on
among the trouts below the banks.
</P>

<P>
'We've got half a dozen,' said Dan, after a warm, wet hour.  'I vote we
go up to Stone Bay and try Long Pool.'
</P>

<P>
Una nodded&mdash;most of her talk was by nods&mdash;and they crept from the gloom
of the tunnels towards the tiny weir that turns the brook into the
mill-stream.  Here the banks are low and bare, and the glare of the
afternoon sun on the Long Pool below the weir makes your eyes ache.
</P>

<P>
When they were in the open they nearly fell down with astonishment.  A
huge grey horse, whose tail-hairs crinkled the glassy water, was
drinking in the pool, and the ripples about his muzzle flashed like
melted gold.  On his back sat an old, white-haired man dressed in a
loose glimmery gown of chain-mail.  He was bare-headed, and a
nut-shaped iron helmet hung at his saddle-bow.  His reins were of red
leather five or six inches deep, scalloped at the edges, and his high
padded saddle with its red girths was held fore and aft by a red
leather breastband and crupper.
</P>

<P>
'Look!' said Una, as though Dan were not staring his very eyes out.
'It's like the picture in your room&mdash;"Sir Isumbras at the Ford".'
</P>

<P>
The rider turned towards them, and his thin, long face was just as
sweet and gentle as that of the knight who carries the children in that
picture.
</P>

<P>
'They should be here now, Sir Richard,' said Puck's deep voice among
the willow-herb.
</P>

<P>
'They are here,' the knight said, and he smiled at Dan with the string
of trouts in his hand.  'There seems no great change in boys since mine
fished this water.'
</P>

<P>
'If your horse has drunk, we shall be more at ease in the Ring,' said
Puck; and he nodded to the children as though he had never magicked
away their memories a week before.
</P>

<P>
The great horse turned and hoisted himself into the pasture with a kick
and a scramble that tore the clods down rattling.
</P>

<P>
'Your pardon!' said Sir Richard to Dan.  'When these lands were mine, I
never loved that mounted men should cross the brook except by the paved
ford.  But my Swallow here was thirsty, and I wished to meet you.'
</P>

<P>
'We're very glad you've come, sir,'said Dan.'It doesn't matter in the
least about the banks.'
</P>

<P>
He trotted across the pasture on the sword side of the mighty horse,
and it was a mighty iron-handled sword that swung from Sir Richard's
belt.  Una walked behind with Puck.  She remembered everything now.
</P>

<P>
'I'm sorry about the Leaves,' he said, 'but it would never have done if
you had gone home and told, would it?'
</P>

<P>
'I s'pose not,' Una answered.  'But you said that all the fair&mdash;People
of the Hills had left England.'
</P>

<P>
'So they have; but I told you that you should come and go and look and
know, didn't I?  The knight isn't a fairy. He's Sir Richard
Dalyngridge, a very old friend of mine. He came over with William the
Conqueror, and he wants to see you particularly.'
</P>

<P>
'What for?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'On account of your great wisdom and learning,' Puck replied, without a
twinkle.
</P>

<P>
'Us?' said Una.  'Why, I don't know my Nine Times&mdash;not to say it
dodging, and Dan makes the most awful mess of fractions.  He can't mean
us!'
</P>

<P>
'Una!' Dan called back.  'Sir Richard says he is going to tell what
happened to Weland's sword.  He's got it.  Isn't it splendid?'
</P>

<P>
'Nay&mdash;nay,' said Sir Richard, dismounting as they reached the Ring, in
the bend of the mill-stream bank.  'It is you that must tell me, for I
hear the youngest child in our England today is as wise as our wisest
clerk.'  He slipped the bit out of Swallow's mouth, dropped the
ruby-red reins over his head, and the wise horse moved off to graze.
</P>

<P>
Sir Richard (they noticed he limped a little) unslung his great sword.
</P>

<P>
'That's it,' Dan whispered to Una.
</P>

<P>
'This is the sword that Brother Hugh had from Wayland-Smith,' Sir
Richard said.  'Once he gave it me, but I would not take it; but at the
last it became mine after such a fight as never christened man fought.
See!' He half drew it from its sheath and turned it before them.  On
either side just below the handle, where the Runic letters shivered as
though they were alive, were two deep gouges in the dull, deadly steel.
'Now, what Thing made those?' said he.  'I know not, but you, perhaps,
can say.'
</P>

<P>
'Tell them all the tale, Sir Richard,' said Puck.  'It concerns their
land somewhat.'
</P>

<P>
'Yes, from the very beginning,' Una pleaded, for the knight's good face
and the smile on it more than ever reminded her of 'Sir Isumbras at the
Ford'.
</P>

<P>
They settled down to listen, Sir Richard bare-headed to the sunshine,
dandling the sword in both hands, while the grey horse cropped outside
the Ring, and the helmet on the saddle-bow clinged softly each time he
jerked his head.
</P>

<P>
'From the beginning, then,' Sir Richard said, 'since it concerns your
land, I will tell the tale.  When our Duke came out of Normandy to take
his England, great knights (have ye heard?) came and strove hard to
serve the Duke, because he promised them lands here, and small knights
followed the great ones.  My folk in Normandy were poor; but a great
knight, Engerrard of the Eagle&mdash;Engenulf De Aquila&mdash;who was kin to my
father, followed the Earl of Mortain, who followed William the Duke,
and I followed De Aquila.  Yes, with thirty men-at-arms out of my
father's house and a new sword, I set out to conquer England three days
after I was made knight.  I did not then know that England would
conquer me.  We went up to Santlache with the rest&mdash;a very great host
of us.'
</P>

<P>
'Does that mean the Battle of Hastings&mdash;Ten Sixty-Six?' Una whispered,
and Puck nodded, so as not to interrupt.
</P>

<P>
'At Santlache, over the hill yonder'&mdash;he pointed south-eastward towards
Fairlight&mdash;'we found Harold's men. We fought.  At the day's end they
ran.  My men went with De Aquila's to chase and plunder, and in that
chase Engerrard of the Eagle was slain, and his son Gilbert took his
banner and his men forward.  This I did not know till after, for
Swallow here was cut in the flank, so I stayed to wash the wound at a
brook by a thorn.  There a single Saxon cried out to me in French, and
we fought together. I should have known his voice, but we fought
together. For a long time neither had any advantage, till by pure
ill-fortune his foot slipped and his sword flew from his hand.  Now I
had but newly been made knight, and wished, above all, to be courteous
and fameworthy, so I forbore to strike and bade him get his sword
again.  "A plague on my sword," said he.  "It has lost me my first
fight.  You have spared my life.  Take my sword." He held it out to me,
but as I stretched my hand the sword groaned like a stricken man, and I
leaped back crying, "Sorcery!"'
</P>

<P>
(The children looked at the sword as though it might speak again.)
</P>

<P>
'Suddenly a clump of Saxons ran out upon me and, seeing a Norman alone,
would have killed me, but my Saxon cried out that I was his prisoner,
and beat them off. Thus, see you, he saved my life.  He put me on my
horse and led me through the woods ten long miles to this valley.'
</P>

<P>
'To here, d'you mean?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'To this very valley.  We came in by the Lower Ford under the King's
Hill yonder'&mdash;he pointed eastward where the valley widens.
</P>

<P>
'And was that Saxon Hugh the novice?' Dan asked.
</P>

<P>
'Yes, and more than that.  He had been for three years at the monastery
at Bec by Rouen, where'&mdash;Sir Richard chuckled&mdash;'the Abbot Herluin would
not suffer me to remain.'
</P>

<P>
'Why wouldn't he?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Because I rode my horse into the refectory, when the scholars were at
meat, to show the Saxon boys we Normans were not afraid of an Abbot.
It was that very Saxon Hugh tempted me to do it, and we had not met
since that day.  I thought I knew his voice even inside my helmet, and,
for all that our Lords fought, we each rejoiced we had not slain the
other.  He walked by my side, and he told me how a heathen God, as he
believed, had given him his sword, but he said he had never heard it
sing before.  I remember I warned him to beware of sorcery and quick
enchantments.'  Sir Richard smiled to himself.  'I was very young&mdash;very
young! 'When we came to his house here we had almost forgotten that we
had been at blows.  It was near midnight, and the Great Hall was full
of men and women waiting news.  There I first saw his sister, the Lady
Aelueva, of whom he had spoken to us in France.  She cried out fiercely
at me, and would have had me hanged in that hour, but her brother said
that I had spared his life&mdash;he said not how he saved mine from the
Saxons&mdash;and that our Duke had won the day; and even while they wrangled
over my poor body, of a sudden he fell down in a swoon from his wounds.
</P>

<P>
"'This is thy fault," said the Lady Aelueva to me, and she kneeled
above him and called for wine and cloths.
</P>

<P>
"'If I had known," I answered, "he should have ridden and I walked.
But he set me on my horse; he made no complaint; he walked beside me
and spoke merrily throughout.  I pray I have done him no harm."
</P>

<P>
"'Thou hast need to pray," she said, catching up her underlip.  "If he
dies, thou shalt hang."
</P>

<P>
'They bore off Hugh to his chamber; but three tall men of the house
bound me and set me under the beam of the Great Hall with a rope round
my neck.  The end of the rope they flung over the beam, and they sat
them down by the fire to wait word whether Hugh lived or died. They
cracked nuts with their knife-hilts the while.'
</P>

<P>
'And how did you feel?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Very weary; but I did heartily pray for my schoolmate Hugh his health.
About noon I heard horses in the valley, and the three men loosed my
ropes and fled out, and De Aquila's men rode up.  Gilbert de Aquila
came with them, for it was his boast that, like his father, he forgot
no man that served him.  He was little, like his father, but terrible,
with a nose like an eagle's nose and yellow eyes like an eagle.  He
rode tall warhorses&mdash;roans, which he bred himself&mdash;and he could never
abide to be helped into the saddle.  He saw the rope hanging from the
beam and laughed, and his men laughed, for I was too stiff to rise.
</P>

<P>
"'This is poor entertainment for a Norman knight," he said, "but, such
as it is, let us be grateful.  Show me, boy, to whom thou owest most,
and we will pay them out of hand."'
</P>

<P>
'What did he mean?  To kill 'em?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Assuredly.  But I looked at the Lady Aelueva where she stood among her
maids, and her brother beside her. De Aquila's men had driven them all
into the Great Hall.'
</P>

<P>
'Was she pretty?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'In all my long life I have never seen woman fit to strew rushes before
my Lady Aelueva,' the knight replied, quite simply and quietly.  'As I
looked at her I thought I might save her and her house by a jest.
</P>

<P>
"'Seeing that I came somewhat hastily and without warning," said I to
De Aquila, "I have no fault to find with the courtesy that these Saxons
have shown me." But my voice shook.  It is&mdash;it was not good to jest
with that little man.
</P>

<P>
'All were silent awhile, till De Aquila laughed.  "Look, men&mdash;a
miracle," said he.  "The fight is scarce sped, my father is not yet
buried, and here we find our youngest knight already set down in his
Manor, while his Saxons&mdash;ye can see it in their fat faces&mdash;have paid
him homage and service!  By the Saints," he said, rubbing his nose, "I
never thought England would be so easy won!  Surely I can do no less
than give the lad what he has taken.  This Manor shall be thine, boy,"
he said, "till I come again, or till thou art slain.  Now, mount, men,
and ride.  We follow our Duke into Kent to make him King of England."
</P>

<P>
'He drew me with him to the door while they brought his horse&mdash;a lean
roan, taller than my Swallow here, but not so well girthed.
</P>

<P>
"'Hark to me," he said, fretting with his great war-gloves.  "I have
given thee this Manor, which is a Saxon hornets' nest, and I think thou
wilt be slain in a month&mdash;as my father was slain.  Yet if thou canst
keep the roof on the hall, the thatch on the barn, and the plough in
the furrow till I come back, thou shalt hold the Manor from me; for the
Duke has promised our Earl Mortain all the lands by Pevensey, and
Mortain will give me of them what he would have given my father.  God
knows if thou or I shall live till England is won; but remember, boy,
that here and now fighting is foolishness and"&mdash;he reached for the
reins&mdash;"craft and cunning is all."
</P>

<P>
"'Alas, I have no cunning," said I.
</P>

<P>
"'Not yet," said he, hopping abroad, foot in stirrup, and poking his
horse in the belly with his toe.  "Not yet, but I think thou hast a
good teacher.  Farewell!  Hold the Manor and live.  Lose the Manor and
hang," he said, and spurred out, his shield-straps squeaking behind him.
</P>

<P>
'So, children, here was I, little more than a boy, and Santlache fight
not two days old, left alone with my thirty men-at-arms, in a land I
knew not, among a people whose tongue I could not speak, to hold down
the land which I had taken from them.'
</P>

<P>
'And that was here at home?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Yes, here.  See!  From the Upper Ford, Weland's Ford, to the Lower
Ford, by the Belle Allee, west and east it ran half a league.  From the
Beacon of Brunanburgh behind us here, south and north it ran a full
league&mdash;and all the woods were full of broken men from Santlache, Saxon
thieves, Norman plunderers, robbers, and deer-stealers. A hornets' nest
indeed!
</P>

<P>
'When De Aquila had gone, Hugh would have thanked me for saving their
lives; but the Lady Aelueva said that I had done it only for the sake
of receiving the Manor.
</P>

<P>
"'How could I know that De Aquila would give it me?" I said.  "If I had
told him I had spent my night in your halter he would have burned the
place twice over by now."
</P>

<P>
"'If any man had put my neck in a rope," she said, "I would have seen
his house burned thrice over before I would have made terms."
</P>

<P>
"'But it was a woman," I said; and I laughed, and she wept and said
that I mocked her in her captivity.
</P>

<P>
"'Lady," said I, "there is no captive in this valley except one, and he
is not a Saxon."
</P>

<P>
'At this she cried that I was a Norman thief, who came with false,
sweet words, having intended from the first to turn her out in the
fields to beg her bread.  Into the fields! She had never seen the face
of war!
</P>

<P>
'I was angry, and answered, "This much at least I can disprove, for I
swear"&mdash;and on my sword-hilt I swore it in that place&mdash;"I swear I will
never set foot in the Great Hall till the Lady Aelueva herself shall
summon me there."
</P>

<P>
'She went away, saying nothing, and I walked out, and Hugh limped after
me, whistling dolorously (that is a custom of the English), and we came
upon the three Saxons that had bound me.  They were now bound by my
men-at-arms, and behind them stood some fifty stark and sullen churls
of the House and the Manor, waiting to see what should fall.  We heard
De Aquila's trumpets blow thin through the woods Kentward.
</P>

<P>
"'Shall we hang these?" said my men.
</P>

<P>
"'Then my churls will fight," said Hugh, beneath his breath; but I bade
him ask the three what mercy they hoped for. "'None," said they all.
"She bade us hang thee if our master died.  And we would have hanged
thee.  There is no more to it."
</P>

<P>
'As I stood doubting, a woman ran down from the oak wood above the
King's Hill yonder, and cried out that some Normans were driving off
the swine there.
</P>

<P>
"'Norman or Saxon," said I, "we must beat them back, or they will rob
us every day.  Out at them with any arms ye have!" So I loosed those
three carles and we ran together, my men-at-arms and the Saxons with
bills and axes which they had hidden in the thatch of their huts, and
Hugh led them.  Half-way up the King's Hill we found a false fellow
from Picardy&mdash;a sutler that sold wine in the Duke's camp&mdash;with a dead
knight's shield on his arm, a stolen horse under him, and some ten or
twelve wastrels at his tail, all cutting and slashing at the pigs.  We
beat them off, and saved our pork.  One hundred and seventy pigs we
saved in that great battle.'  Sir Richard laughed.
</P>

<P>
'That, then, was our first work together, and I bade Hugh tell his folk
that so would I deal with any man, knight or churl, Norman or Saxon,
who stole as much as one egg from our valley.  Said he to me, riding
home: "Thou hast gone far to conquer England this evening." I answered:
"England must be thine and mine, then.  Help me, Hugh, to deal aright
with these people.  Make them to know that if they slay me De Aquila
will surely send to slay them, and he will put a worse man in my place."
</P>

<P>
"That may well be true," said he, and gave me his hand. "Better the
devil we know than the devil we know not, till we can pack you Normans
home." And so, too, said his Saxons; and they laughed as we drove the
pigs downhill. But I think some of them, even then, began not to hate
me.'
</P>

<P>
'I like Brother Hugh,' said Una, softly.
</P>

<P>
'Beyond question he was the most perfect, courteous, valiant, tender,
and wise knight that ever drew breath,' said Sir Richard, caressing the
sword.  'He hung up his sword&mdash;this sword&mdash;on the wall of the Great
Hall, because he said it was fairly mine, and never he took it down
till De Aquila returned, as I shall presently show. For three months
his men and mine guarded the valley, till all robbers and nightwalkers
learned there was nothing to get from us save hard tack and a hanging.
Side by side we fought against all who came&mdash;thrice a week sometimes we
fought&mdash;against thieves and landless knights looking for good manors.
Then we were in some peace, and I made shift by Hugh's help to govern
the valley&mdash;for all this valley of yours was my Manor&mdash;as a knight
should.  I kept the roof on the hall and the thatch on the barn, but
... the English are a bold people.  His Saxons would laugh and jest
with Hugh, and Hugh with them, and&mdash;this was marvellous to me&mdash;if even
the meanest of them said that such and such a thing was the Custom of
the Manor, then straightway would Hugh and such old men of the Manor as
might be near forsake everything else to debate the matter&mdash;I have seen
them stop the Mill with the corn half ground&mdash;and if the custom or
usage were proven to be as it was said, why, that was the end of it,
even though it were flat against Hugh, his wish and command.
Wonderful!'
</P>

<P>
'Aye,' said Puck, breaking in for the first time.  'The Custom of Old
England was here before your Norman knights came, and it outlasted
them, though they fought against it cruel.' 'Not I,' said Sir Richard.
'I let the Saxons go their stubborn way, but when my own men-at-arms,
Normans not six months in England, stood up and told me what was the
custom of the country, then I was angry.  Ah, good days!  Ah, wonderful
people!  And I loved them all.' The knight lifted his arms as though he
would hug the whole dear valley, and Swallow, hearing the chink of his
chain-mail, looked up and whinnied softly.
</P>

<P>
'At last,' he went on, 'after a year of striving and contriving and
some little driving, De Aquila came to the valley, alone and without
warning.  I saw him first at the Lower Ford, with a swineherd's brat on
his saddle-bow.
</P>

<P>
"'There is no need for thee to give any account of thy stewardship,"
said he.  "I have it all from the child here." And he told me how the
young thing had stopped his tall horse at the Ford, by waving of a
branch, and crying that the way was barred.  "And if one bold, bare
babe be enough to guard the Ford in these days, thou hast done well,"
said he, and puffed and wiped his head.
</P>

<P>
'He pinched the child's cheek, and looked at our cattle in the flat by
the river.
</P>

<P>
"'Both fat," said he, rubbing his nose.  "This is craft and cunning
such as I love.  What did I tell thee when I rode away, boy?"
</P>

<P>
"'Hold the Manor or hang," said I.  I had never forgotten it.
</P>

<P>
"'True.  And thou hast held." He clambered from his saddle and with his
sword's point cut out a turf from the bank and gave it me where I
kneeled.' Dan looked at Una, and Una looked at Dan. 'That's seisin,'
said Puck, in a whisper.
</P>

<P>
"'Now thou art lawfully seised of the Manor, Sir Richard," said
he&mdash;'twas the first time he ever called me that&mdash;"thou and thy heirs
for ever.  This must serve till the King's clerks write out thy title
on a parchment.  England is all ours&mdash;if we can hold it."
</P>

<P>
"'What service shall I pay?" I asked, and I remember I was proud beyond
words.
</P>

<P>
"'Knight's fee, boy, knight's fee!" said he, hopping round his horse on
one foot.  (Have I said he was little, and could not endure to be
helped to his saddle?) "Six mounted men or twelve archers thou shalt
send me whenever I call for them, and&mdash;where got you that corn?" said
he, for it was near harvest, and our corn stood well. "I have never
seen such bright straw.  Send me three bags of the same seed yearly,
and furthermore, in memory of our last meeting&mdash;with the rope round thy
neck&mdash;entertain me and my men for two days of each year in the Great
Hall of thy Manor."
</P>

<P>
"'Alas!" said I, "then my Manor is already forfeit.  I am under vow not
to enter the Great Hall." And I told him what I had sworn to the Lady
Aelueva.'
</P>

<P>
'And hadn't you ever been into the house since?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Never,' Sir Richard answered, smiling.  'I had made me a little hut of
wood up the hill, and there I did justice and slept ...  De Aquila
wheeled aside, and his shield shook on his back.  "No matter, boy,"
said he.  "I will remit the homage for a year."'
</P>

<P>
'He meant Sir Richard needn't give him dinner there the first year,'
Puck explained.
</P>

<P>
'De Aquila stayed with me in the hut, and Hugh, who could read and
write and cast accounts, showed him the Roll of the Manor, in which
were written all the names of our fields and men, and he asked a
thousand questions touching the land, the timber, the grazing, the
mill, and the fish-ponds, and the worth of every man in the valley. But
never he named the Lady Aelueva's name, nor went he near the Great
Hall.  By night he drank with us in the hut.  Yes, he sat on the straw
like an eagle ruffled in her feathers, his yellow eyes rolling above
the cup, and he pounced in his talk like an eagle, swooping from one
thing to another, but always binding fast.  Yes; he would lie still
awhile, and then rustle in the straw, and speak sometimes as though he
were King William himself, and anon he would speak in parables and
tales, and if at once we saw not his meaning he would yerk us in the
ribs with his scabbarded sword.
</P>

<P>
"'Look you, boys," said he, "I am born out of my due time.  Five
hundred years ago I would have made all England such an England as
neither Dane, Saxon, nor Norman should have conquered.  Five hundred
years hence I should have been such a counsellor to Kings as the world
hath never dreamed of.  'Tis all here," said he, tapping his big head,
"but it hath no play in this black age.  Now Hugh here is a better man
than thou art, Richard." He had made his voice harsh and croaking, like
a raven's.
</P>

<P>
"'Truth," said I.  "But for Hugh, his help and patience and
long-suffering, I could never have kept the Manor."
</P>

<P>
"'Nor thy life either," said De Aquila.  "Hugh has saved thee not once,
but a hundred times.  Be still, Hugh!" he said.  "Dost thou know,
Richard, why Hugh slept, and why he still sleeps, among thy Norman
men-at-arms?"
</P>

<P>
"'To be near me," said I, for I thought this was truth.
</P>

<P>
"'Fool!" said De Aquila.  "It is because his Saxons have begged him to
rise against thee, and to sweep every Norman out of the valley.  No
matter how I know.  It is truth.  Therefore Hugh hath made himself an
hostage for thy life, well knowing that if any harm befell thee from
his Saxons thy Normans would slay him without remedy.  And this his
Saxons know.  Is it true, Hugh?"
</P>

<P>
"'In some sort," said Hugh shamefacedly; "at least, it was true half a
year ago.  My Saxons would not harm Richard now.  I think they know
him&mdash;but I judged it best to make sure."
</P>

<P>
'Look, children, what that man had done&mdash;and I had never guessed it!
Night after night had he lain down among my men-at-arms, knowing that
if one Saxon had lifted knife against me, his life would have answered
for mine.
</P>

<P>
"'Yes," said De Aquila.  "And he is a swordless man." He pointed to
Hugh's belt, for Hugh had put away his sword&mdash;did I tell you?&mdash;-the day
after it flew from his hand at Santlache.  He carried only the short
knife and the long-bow.  "Swordless and landless art thou, Hugh; and
they call thee kin to Earl Godwin." (Hugh was indeed of Godwin's
blood.) "The Manor that was thine is given to this boy and to his
children for ever.  Sit up and beg, for he can turn thee out like a
dog, Hugh."
</P>

<P>
'Hugh said nothing, but I heard his teeth grind, and I bade De Aquila,
my own overlord, hold his peace, or I would stuff his words down his
throat.  Then De Aquila laughed till the tears ran down his face.
</P>

<P>
"'I warned the King," said he, "what would come of giving England to us
Norman thieves.  Here art thou, Richard, less than two days confirmed
in thy Manor, and already thou hast risen against thy overlord.  What
shall we do to him, Sir Hugh?"
</P>

<P>
"'I am a swordless man," said Hugh.  "Do not jest with me," and he laid
his head on his knees and groaned.
</P>

<P>
"'The greater fool thou," said De Aquila, and all his voice changed;
"for I have given thee the Manor of Dallington up the hill this
half-hour since," and he yerked at Hugh with his scabbard across the
straw.
</P>

<P>
"'To me?" said Hugh.  "I am a Saxon, and, except that I love Richard
here, I have not sworn fealty to any Norman."
</P>

<P>
"'In God's good time, which because of my sins I shall not live to see,
there will be neither Saxon nor Norman in England," said De Aquila.
"If I know men, thou art more faithful unsworn than a score of Normans
I could name.  Take Dallington, and join Sir Richard to fight me
tomorrow, if it please thee!"
</P>

<P>
"'Nay," said Hugh.  "I am no child.  Where I take a gift, there I
render service"; and he put his hands between De Aquila's, and swore to
be faithful, and, as I remember, I kissed him, and De Aquila kissed us
both.
</P>

<P>
'We sat afterwards outside the hut while the sun rose, and De Aquila
marked our churls going to their work in the fields, and talked of holy
things, and how we should govern our Manors in time to come, and of
hunting and of horse-breeding, and of the King's wisdom and unwisdom;
for he spoke to us as though we were in all sorts now his brothers.
Anon a churl stole up to me&mdash;he was one of the three I had not hanged a
year ago&mdash;and he bellowed&mdash;which is the Saxon for whispering&mdash;that the
Lady Aelueva would speak to me at the Great House.  She walked abroad
daily in the Manor, and it was her custom to send me word whither she
went, that I might set an archer or two behind and in front to guard
her.  Very often I myself lay up in the woods and watched on her also.
</P>

<P>
'I went swiftly, and as I passed the great door it opened from within,
and there stood my Lady Aelueva, and she said to me:  "Sir Richard,
will it please you enter your Great Hall?"  Then she wept, but we were
alone.'
</P>

<P>
The knight was silent for a long time, his face turned across the
valley, smiling. 'Oh, well done!' said Una, and clapped her hands very
softly.  'She was sorry, and she said so.'
</P>

<P>
'Aye, she was sorry, and she said so,' said Sir Richard, coming back
with a little start.  'Very soon&mdash;but he said it was two full hours
later&mdash;De Aquila rode to the door, with his shield new scoured (Hugh
had cleansed it), and demanded entertainment, and called me a false
knight, that would starve his overlord to death.  Then Hugh cried out
that no man should work in the valley that day, and our Saxons blew
horns, and set about feasting and drinking, and running of races, and
dancing and singing; and De Aquila climbed upon a horse-block and spoke
to them in what he swore was good Saxon, but no man understood it.  At
night we feasted in the Great Hall, and when the harpers and the
singers were gone we four sat late at the high table.  As I remember,
it was a warm night with a full moon, and De Aquila bade Hugh take down
his sword from the wall again, for the honour of the Manor of
Dallington, and Hugh took it gladly enough. Dust lay on the hilt, for I
saw him blow it off.
</P>

<P>
'She and I sat talking a little apart, and at first we thought the
harpers had come back, for the Great Hall was filled with a rushing
noise of music.  De Aquila leaped up; but there was only the moonlight
fretty on the floor.
</P>

<P>
"'Hearken!" said Hugh.  "It is my sword," and as he belted it on the
music ceased.
</P>

<P>
"'Over Gods, forbid that I should ever belt blade like that," said De
Aquila.  "What does it foretell?"
</P>

<P>
"'The Gods that made it may know.  Last time it spoke was at Hastings,
when I lost all my lands.  Belike it sings now that I have new lands
and am a man again," said Hugh.
</P>

<P>
'He loosed the blade a little and drove it back happily into the
sheath, and the sword answered him low and crooningly, as&mdash;as a woman
would speak to a man, her head on his shoulder.
</P>

<P>
'Now that was the second time in all my life I heard this Sword sing.'
...
</P>

<BR>

<P>
'Look!' said Una.  'There's Mother coming down the Long Slip.  What
will she say to Sir Richard?  She can't help seeing him.'
</P>

<P>
'And Puck can't magic us this time,' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Are you sure?' said Puck; and he leaned forward and whispered to Sir
Richard, who, smiling, bowed his head. 'But what befell the sword and
my brother Hugh I will tell on another time,' said he, rising.  'Ohe,
Swallow!' The great horse cantered up from the far end of the meadow,
close to Mother.
</P>

<P>
They heard Mother say:  'Children, Gleason's old horse has broken into
the meadow again.  Where did he get through?'
</P>

<P>
'Just below Stone Bay,' said Dan.  'He tore down simple flobs of the
bank!  We noticed it just now.  And we've caught no end of fish.  We've
been at it all the afternoon.' And they honestly believed that they
had.  They never noticed the Oak, Ash and Thorn leaves that Puck had
slyly thrown into their laps.

<P>
It was too hot to run about in the open, so Dan asked their friend, old
Hobden, to take their own dinghy from the pond and put her on the brook
at the bottom of the garden.  Her painted name was the Daisy, but for
exploring expeditions she was the Golden Hind or the Long Serpent, or
some such suitable name.  Dan hiked and howked with a boat-hook (the
brook was too narrow for sculls), and Una punted with a piece of
hop-pole.  When they came to a very shallow place (the Golden Hind drew
quite three inches of water) they disembarked and scuffled her over the
gravel by her tow-rope, and when they reached the overgrown banks
beyond the garden they pulled themselves upstream by the low branches.
</P>

<P>
That day they intended to discover the North Cape like 'Othere, the old
sea-captain', in the book of verses which Una had brought with her; but
on account of the heat they changed it to a voyage up the Amazon and
the sources of the Nile.  Even on the shaded water the air was hot and
heavy with drowsy scents, while outside, through breaks in the trees,
the sunshine burned the pasture like fire.  The kingfisher was asleep
on his watching-branch, and the blackbirds scarcely took the trouble to
dive into the next bush.  Dragonflies wheeling and clashing were the
only things at work, except the moorhens and a big Red Admiral, who
flapped down out of the sunshine for a drink.
</P>

<P>
When they reached Otter Pool the Golden Hind grounded comfortably on a
shallow, and they lay beneath a roof of close green, watching the water
trickle over the flood-gates down the mossy brick chute from the
mill-stream to the brook.  A big trout&mdash;the children knew him
well&mdash;rolled head and shoulders at some fly that sailed round the bend,
while, once in just so often, the brook rose a fraction of an inch
against all the wet pebbles, and they watched the slow draw and shiver
of a breath of air through the tree-tops.  Then the little voices of
the slipping water began again.
</P>

<P>
'It's like the shadows talking, isn't it?' said Una.  She had given up
trying to read.  Dan lay over the bows, trailing his hands in the
current.  They heard feet on the gravel-bar that runs half across the
pool and saw Sir Richard Dalyngridge standing over them.
</P>

<P>
'Was yours a dangerous voyage?' he asked, smiling.
</P>

<P>
'She bumped a lot, sir,' said Dan.  'There's hardly any water this
summer.'
</P>

<P>
'Ah, the brook was deeper and wider when my children played at Danish
pirates.  Are you pirate-folk?'
</P>

<P>
'Oh no.  We gave up being pirates years ago,'explained Una.  'We're
nearly always explorers now.  Sailing round the world, you know.'
</P>

<P>
'Round?' said Sir Richard.  He sat him in the comfortable crotch of an
old ash-root on the bank.  'How can it be round?'
</P>

<P>
'Wasn't it in your books?' Dan suggested.  He had been doing geography
at his last lesson.
</P>

<P>
'I can neither write nor read,' he replied.  'Canst thou read, child?'
</P>

<P>
'Yes,' said Dan, 'barring the very long words.'
</P>

<P>
'Wonderful!  Read to me, that I may hear for myself.'
</P>

<P>
Dan flushed, but opened the book and began&mdash;gabbling a little&mdash;at 'The
Discoverer of the North Cape.'
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'Othere, the old sea-captain,<BR>
     Who dwelt in Helgoland,<BR>
     To King Alfred, the lover of truth,<BR>
     Brought a snow-white walrus-tooth,<BR>
     Which he held in his brown right hand.'<BR>
</P>

<P>
'But&mdash;but&mdash;this I know!  This is an old song!  This I have heard sung!
This is a miracle,' Sir Richard interrupted. 'Nay, do not stop!'  He
leaned forward, and the shadows of the leaves slipped and slid upon his
chain-mail.
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     "'I ploughed the land with horses,<BR>
     But my heart was ill at ease,<BR>
     For the old seafaring men<BR>
     Came to me now and then<BR>
     With their sagas of the seas."'<BR>
</P>

<P>
His hand fell on the hilt of the great sword.  'This is truth,' he
cried, 'for so did it happen to me,' and he beat time delightedly to
the tramp of verse after verse.
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     "'And now the land," said Othere,<BR>
     "Bent southward suddenly,<BR>
     And I followed the curving shore,<BR>
     And ever southward bore<BR>
     Into a nameless sea."'<BR>
</P>

<P>
'A nameless sea!' he repeated.  'So did I&mdash;so did Hugh and I.'
</P>

<P>
'Where did you go?  Tell us,' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Wait.  Let me hear all first.'  So Dan read to the poem's very end.
</P>

<P>
'Good,' said the knight.  'That is Othere's tale&mdash;even so I have heard
the men in the Dane ships sing it.  Not those same valiant words, but
something like to them.'
</P>

<P>
'Have you ever explored North?'  Dan shut the book.
</P>

<P>
'Nay.  My venture was South.  Farther South than any man has fared,
Hugh and I went down with Witta and his heathen.'  He jerked the tall
sword forward, and leaned on it with both hands; but his eyes looked
long past them.
</P>

<P>
'I thought you always lived here,' said Una, timidly.
</P>

<P>
'Yes; while my Lady Aelueva lived.  But she died.  She died.  Then, my
eldest son being a man, I asked De Aquila's leave that he should hold
the Manor while I went on some journey or pilgrimage&mdash;to forget. De
Aquila, whom the Second William had made Warden of Pevensey in Earl
Mortain's place, was very old then, but still he rode his tall, roan
horses, and in the saddle he looked like a little white falcon.  When
Hugh, at Dallington, over yonder, heard what I did, he sent for my
second son, whom being unmarried he had ever looked upon as his own
child, and, by De Aquila's leave, gave him the Manor of Dallington to
hold till he should return. Then Hugh came with me.'
</P>

<P>
'When did this happen?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'That I can answer to the very day, for as we rode with De Aquila by
Pevensey&mdash;have I said that he was Lord of Pevensey and of the Honour of
the Eagle?&mdash;-to the Bordeaux ship that fetched him his wines yearly out
of France, a Marsh man ran to us crying that he had seen a great black
goat which bore on his back the body of the King, and that the goat had
spoken to him.  On that same day Red William our King, the Conqueror's
son, died of a secret arrow while he hunted in a forest.  "This is a
cross matter," said De Aquila, "to meet on the threshold of a journey.
If Red William be dead I may have to fight for my lands.  Wait a
little."
</P>

<P>
'My Lady being dead, I cared nothing for signs and omens, nor Hugh
either.  We took that wine-ship to go to Bordeaux; but the wind failed
while we were yet in sight of Pevensey, a thick mist hid us, and we
drifted with the tide along the cliffs to the west.  Our company was,
for the most part, merchants returning to France, and we were laden
with wool and there were three couple of tall hunting-dogs chained to
the rail.  Their master was a knight of Artois.  His name I never
learned, but his shield bore gold pieces on a red ground, and he
limped, much as I do, from a wound which he had got in his youth at
Mantes siege.  He served the Duke of Burgundy against the Moors in
Spain, and was returning to that war with his dogs.  He sang us strange
Moorish songs that first night, and half persuaded us to go with him.
I was on pilgrimage to forget&mdash;which is what no pilgrimage brings.  I
think I would have gone, but...
</P>

<P>
'Look you how the life and fortune of man changes! Towards morning a
Dane ship, rowing silently, struck against us in the mist, and while we
rolled hither and yon Hugh, leaning over the rail, fell outboard.  I
leaped after him, and we two tumbled aboard the Dane, and were caught
and bound ere we could rise.  Our own ship was swallowed up in the
mist.  I judge the Knight of the Gold Pieces muzzled his dogs with his
cloak, lest they should give tongue and betray the merchants, for I
heard their baying suddenly stop.
</P>

<P>
'We lay bound among the benches till morning, when the Danes dragged us
to the high deck by the steering-place, and their captain&mdash;Witta, he
was called&mdash;turned us over with his foot.  Bracelets of gold from elbow
to armpit he wore, and his red hair was long as a woman's, and came
down in plaited locks on his shoulder.  He was stout, with bowed legs
and long arms.  He spoiled us of all we had, but when he laid hand on
Hugh's sword and saw the runes on the blade hastily he thrust it back.
Yet his covetousness overcame him and he tried again and again, and the
third time the Sword sang loud and angrily, so that the rowers leaned
on their oars to listen. Here they all spoke together, screaming like
gulls, and a Yellow Man, such as I have never seen, came to the high
deck and cut our bonds.  He was yellow&mdash;not from sickness, but by
nature&mdash;yellow as honey, and his eyes stood endwise in his head.'
</P>

<P>
'How do you mean?' said Una, her chin on her hand.
</P>

<P>
'Thus,' said Sir Richard.  He put a finger to the corner of each eye,
and pushed it up till his eyes narrowed to slits.
</P>

<P>
'Why, you look just like a Chinaman!' cried Dan.  'Was the man a
Chinaman?'
</P>

<P>
'I know not what that may be.  Witta had found him half dead among ice
on the shores of Muscovy.  We thought he was a devil.  He crawled
before us and brought food in a silver dish which these sea-wolves had
robbed from some rich abbey, and Witta with his own hands gave us wine.
He spoke a little in French, a little in South Saxon, and much in the
Northman's tongue.  We asked him to set us ashore, promising to pay him
better ransom than he would get price if he sold us to the Moors&mdash;as
once befell a knight of my acquaintance sailing from Flushing.
</P>

<P>
"'Not by my father Guthrum's head," said he.  "The Gods sent ye into my
ship for a luck-offering."
</P>

<P>
'At this I quaked, for I knew it was still the Danes' custom to
sacrifice captives to their Gods for fair weather.
</P>

<P>
"'A plague on thy four long bones!" said Hugh.  "What profit canst thou
make of poor old pilgrims that can neither work nor fight?"
</P>

<P>
"'Gods forbid I should fight against thee, poor Pilgrim with the
Singing Sword," said he.  "Come with us and be poor no more.  Thy teeth
are far apart, which is a sure sign thou wilt travel and grow rich."
</P>

<P>
"'What if we will not come?" said Hugh. "'Swim to England or France,"
said Witta.  "We are midway between the two.  Unless ye choose to drown
yourselves no hair of your head will be harmed here aboard.  We think
ye bring us luck, and I myself know the runes on that Sword are good."
He turned and bade them hoist sail.
</P>

<P>
'Hereafter all made way for us as we walked about the ship, and the
ship was full of wonders.'
</P>

<P>
'What was she like?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Long, low, and narrow, bearing one mast with a red sail, and rowed by
fifteen oars a side,' the knight answered.  'At her bows was a deck
under which men might lie, and at her stern another shut off by a
painted door from the rowers' benches.  Here Hugh and I slept, with
Witta and the Yellow Man, upon tapestries as soft as wool.  I
remember'&mdash;he laughed to himself&mdash;'when first we entered there a loud
voice cried, "Out swords!  Out swords!  Kill, kill!" Seeing us start
Witta laughed, and showed us it was but a great-beaked grey bird with a
red tail.  He sat her on his shoulder, and she called for bread and
wine hoarsely, and prayed him to kiss her.  Yet she was no more than a
silly bird.  But&mdash;ye knew this?'  He looked at their smiling faces.
</P>

<P>
'We weren't laughing at you,' said Una.  'That must have been a parrot.
It's just what Pollies do.'
</P>

<P>
'So we learned later.  But here is another marvel.  The Yellow Man,
whose name was Kitai, had with him a brown box.  In the box was a blue
bowl with red marks upon the rim, and within the bowl, hanging from a
fine thread, was a piece of iron no thicker than that grass stem, and
as long, maybe, as my spur, but straight.  In this iron, said Witta,
abode an Evil Spirit which Kitai, the Yellow Man, had brought by Art
Magic out of his own country that lay three years' journey southward.
The Evil Spirit strove day and night to return to his country, and
therefore, look you, the iron needle pointed continually to the South.'
</P>

<P>
'South?' said Dan suddenly, and put his hand into his pocket.
</P>

<P>
'With my own eyes I saw it.  Every day and all day long, though the
ship rolled, though the sun and the moon and the stars were hid, this
blind Spirit in the iron knew whither it would go, and strained to the
South.  Witta called it the Wise Iron, because it showed him his way
across the unknowable seas.'  Again Sir Richard looked keenly at the
children.  'How think ye?  Was it sorcery?'
</P>

<P>
'Was it anything like this?'  Dan fished out his old brass
pocket-compass, that generally lived with his knife and key-ring.  'The
glass has got cracked, but the needle waggles all right, sir.'
</P>

<P>
The knight drew a long breath of wonder.  'Yes, yes! The Wise Iron
shook and swung in just this fashion.  Now it is still.  Now it points
to the South.'
</P>

<P>
'North,' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Nay, South!  There is the South,'said Sir Richard.  Then they both
laughed, for naturally when one end of a straight compass-needle points
to the North, the other must point to the South.
</P>

<P>
'Te,' said Sir Richard, clicking his tongue.  'There can be no sorcery
if a child carries it.  Wherefore does it point South&mdash;or North?'
</P>

<P>
'Father says that nobody knows,' said Una.
</P>

<P>
Sir Richard looked relieved.  'Then it may still be magic. It was magic
to us.  And so we voyaged.  When the wind served we hoisted sail, and
lay all up along the windward rail, our shields on our backs to break
the spray.  When it failed, they rowed with long oars; the Yellow Man
sat by the Wise Iron, and Witta steered.  At first I feared the great
white-flowering waves, but as I saw how wisely Witta led his ship among
them I grew bolder.  Hugh liked it well from the first.  My skill is
not upon the water; and rocks and whirlpools such as we saw by the West
Isles of France, where an oar caught on a rock and broke, are much
against my stomach.  We sailed South across a stormy sea, where by
moonlight, between clouds, we saw a Flanders ship roll clean over and
sink.  Again, though Hugh laboured with Witta all night, I lay under
the deck with the Talking Bird, and cared not whether I lived or died.
There is a sickness of the sea which for three days is pure death!
When we next saw land Witta said it was Spain, and we stood out to sea.
That coast was full of ships busy in the Duke's war against the Moors,
and we feared to be hanged by the Duke's men or sold into slavery by
the Moors.  So we put into a small harbour which Witta knew.  At night
men came down with loaded mules, and Witta exchanged amber out of the
North against little wedges of iron and packets of beads in earthen
pots.  The pots he put under the decks, and the wedges of iron he laid
on the bottom of the ship after he had cast out the stones and shingle
which till then had been our ballast.  Wine, too, he bought for lumps
of sweet-smelling grey amber&mdash;a little morsel no bigger than a
thumb-nail purchased a cask of wine.  But I speak like a merchant.'
'No, no!  Tell us what you had to eat,' cried Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Meat dried in the sun, and dried fish and ground beans, Witta took in;
and corded frails of a certain sweet, soft fruit, which the Moors use,
which is like paste of figs, but with thin, long stones.  Aha!  Dates
is the name.
</P>

<P>
"'Now," said Witta, when the ship was loaded, "I counsel you strangers
to pray to your Gods, for, from here on, our road is No Man's road." He
and his men killed a black goat for sacrifice on the bows; and the
Yellow Man brought out a small, smiling image of dull-green stone and
burned incense before it.  Hugh and I commended ourselves to God, and
Saint Barnabas, and Our Lady of the Assumption, who was specially dear
to my Lady.  We were not young, but I think no shame to say whenas we
drove out of that secret harbour at sunrise over a still sea, we two
rejoiced and sang as did the knights of old when they followed our
great Duke to England.  Yet was our leader an heathen pirate; all our
proud fleet but one galley perilously overloaded; for guidance we
leaned on a pagan sorcerer; and our port was beyond the world's end.
Witta told us that his father Guthrum had once in his life rowed along
the shores of Africa to a land where naked men sold gold for iron and
beads.  There had he bought much gold, and no few elephants' teeth, and
thither by help of the Wise Iron would Witta go.  Witta feared
nothing&mdash;except to be poor.
</P>

<P>
"'My father told me," said Witta, "that a great Shoal runs three days'
sail out from that land, and south of the shoal lies a Forest which
grows in the sea.  South and east of the Forest my father came to a
place where the men hid gold in their hair; but all that country, he
said, was full of Devils who lived in trees, and tore folk limb from
limb. How think ye?"
</P>

<P>
"'Gold or no gold," said Hugh, fingering his sword, "it is a joyous
venture.  Have at these Devils of thine, Witta!"
</P>

<P>
"'Venture!" said Witta sourly.  "I am only a poor sea-thief.  I do not
set my life adrift on a plank for joy, or the venture.  Once I beach
ship again at Stavanger, and feel the wife's arms round my neck, I'll
seek no more ventures.  A ship is heavier care than a wife or cattle."
</P>

<P>
'He leaped down among the rowers, chiding them for their little
strength and their great stomachs.  Yet Witta was a wolf in fight, and
a very fox in cunning.
</P>

<P>
'We were driven South by a storm, and for three days and three nights
he took the stern-oar, and threddled the longship through the sea.
When it rose beyond measure he brake a pot of whale's oil upon the
water, which wonderfully smoothed it, and in that anointed patch he
turned her head to the wind and threw out oars at the end of a rope, to
make, he said, an anchor at which we lay rolling sorely, but dry.  This
craft his father Guthrum had shown him.  He knew, too, all the
Leech-Book of Bald, who was a wise doctor, and he knew the Ship-Book of
Hlaf the Woman, who robbed Egypt.  He knew all the care of a ship.
</P>

<P>
'After the storm we saw a mountain whose top was covered with snow and
pierced the clouds.  The grasses under this mountain, boiled and eaten,
are a good cure for soreness of the gums and swelled ankles.  We lay
there eight days, till men in skins threw stones at us.  When the heat
increased Witta spread a cloth on bent sticks above the rowers, for the
wind failed between the Island of the Mountain and the shore of Africa,
which is east of it.  That shore is sandy, and we rowed along it within
three bowshots.  Here we saw whales, and fish in the shape of shields,
but longer than our ship.  Some slept, some opened their mouths at us,
and some danced on the hot waters.  The water was hot to the hand, and
the sky was hidden by hot, grey mists, out of which blew a fine dust
that whitened our hair and beards of a morning.  Here, too, were fish
that flew in the air like birds.  They would fall on the laps of the
rowers, and when we went ashore we would roast and eat them.'

<P>
The knight paused to see if the children doubted him, but they only
nodded and said, 'Go on.'
</P>

<P>
'The yellow land lay on our left, the grey sea on our right.  Knight
though I was, I pulled my oar amongst the rowers.  I caught seaweed and
dried it, and stuffed it between the pots of beads lest they should
break.  Knighthood is for the land.  At sea, look you, a man is but a
spurless rider on a bridleless horse.  I learned to make strong knots
in ropes&mdash;yes, and to join two ropes end to end, so that even Witta
could scarcely see where they had been married.  But Hugh had tenfold
more sea-cunning than I.  Witta gave him charge of the rowers of the
left side.  Thorkild of Borkum, a man with a broken nose, that wore a
Norman steel cap, had the rowers of the right, and each side rowed and
sang against the other.  They saw that no man Was idle.  Truly, as Hugh
said, and Witta would laugh at him, a ship is all more care than a
Manor.
</P>

<P>
'How?  Thus.  There was water to fetch from the shore when we could
find it, as well as wild fruit and grasses, and sand for scrubbing of
the decks and benches to keep them sweet.  Also we hauled the ship out
on low islands and emptied all her gear, even to the iron wedges, and
burned off the weed, that had grown on her, with torches of rush, and
smoked below the decks with rushes dampened in salt water, as Hlaf the
Woman orders in her Ship-Book.  Once when we were thus stripped, and
the ship lay propped on her keel, the bird cried, "Out swords!" as
though she saw an enemy.  Witta vowed he would wring her neck.'
</P>

<P>
'Poor Polly!  Did he?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Nay.  She was the ship's bird.  She could call all the rowers by
name...  Those were good days&mdash;for a wifeless man&mdash;with Witta and his
heathen&mdash;beyond the world's end...  After many weeks we came on the
great Shoal which stretched, as Witta's father had said, far out to
sea.  We skirted it till we were giddy with the sight and dizzy with
the sound of bars and breakers, and when we reached land again we found
a naked black people dwelling among woods, who for one wedge of iron
loaded us with fruits and grasses and eggs.  Witta scratched his head
at them in sign he would buy gold.  They had no gold, but they
understood the sign (all the gold-traders hide their gold in their
thick hair), for they pointed along the coast.  They beat, too, on
their chests with their clenched hands, and that, if we had known it,
was an evil sign.'
</P>

<P>
'What did it mean?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Patience.  Ye shall hear.  We followed the coast eastward sixteen days
(counting time by sword-cuts on the helm-rail) till we came to the
Forest in the Sea.  Trees grew there out of mud, arched upon lean and
high roots, and many muddy waterways ran allwhither into darkness,
under the trees.  Here we lost the sun.  We followed the winding
channels between the trees, and where we could not row we laid hold of
the crusted roots and hauled ourselves along.  The water was foul, and
great glittering flies tormented us.  Morning and evening a blue mist
covered the mud, which bred fevers.  Four of our rowers sickened, and
were bound to their benches, lest they should leap overboard and be
eaten by the monsters of the mud.  The Yellow Man lay sick beside the
Wise Iron, rolling his head and talking in his own tongue.  Only the
Bird throve.  She sat on Witta's shoulder and screamed in that noisome,
silent darkness.  Yes; I think it was the silence we most feared.'
</P>

<P>
He paused to listen to the comfortable home noises of the brook.
</P>

<P>
'When we had lost count of time among those black gullies and swashes
we heard, as it were, a drum beat far off, and following it we broke
into a broad, brown river by a hut in a clearing among fields of
pumpkins.  We thanked God to see the sun again.  The people of the
village gave the good welcome, and Witta scratched his head at them
(for gold), and showed them our iron and beads.  They ran to the
bank&mdash;we were still in the ship&mdash;and pointed to our swords and bows,
for always when near shore we lay armed.  Soon they fetched store of
gold in bars and in dust from their huts, and some great blackened
elephants' teeth.  These they piled on the bank, as though to tempt us,
and made signs of dealing blows in battle, and pointed up to the
tree-tops, and to the forest behind.  Their captain or chief sorcerer
then beat on his chest with his fists, and gnashed his teeth.
</P>

<P>
'Said Thorkild of Borkum:  "Do they mean we must fight for all this
gear?" and he half drew sword.
</P>

<P>
"'Nay," said Hugh.  "I think they ask us to league against some enemy."
</P>

<P>
"'I like this not," said Witta, of a sudden.  "Back into mid-stream."
</P>

<P>
'So we did, and sat still all, watching the black folk and the gold
they piled on the bank.  Again we heard drums beat in the forest, and
the people fled to their huts, leaving the gold unguarded.
</P>

<P>
'Then Hugh, at the bows, pointed without speech, and we saw a great
Devil come out of the forest.  He shaded his brows with his hand, and
moistened his pink tongue between his lips&mdash;thus.'
</P>

<P>
'A Devil!' said Dan, delightfully horrified.
</P>

<P>
'Yea.  Taller than a man; covered with reddish hair. When he had well
regarded our ship, he beat on his chest with his fists till it sounded
like rolling drums, and came to the bank swinging all his body between
his long arms, and gnashed his teeth at us.  Hugh loosed arrow, and
pierced him through the throat.  He fell roaring, and three other
Devils ran out of the forest and hauled him into a tall tree out of
sight.  Anon they cast down the blood-stained arrow, and lamented
together among the leaves.
</P>

<P>
Witta saw the gold on the bank; he was loath to leave it. "Sirs," said
he (no man had spoken till then), "yonder is what we have come so far
and so painfully to find, laid out to our very hand.  Let us row in
while these Devils bewail themselves, and at least bear off what we
may."
</P>

<P>
'Bold as a wolf, cunning as a fox was Witta!  He set four archers on
the fore-deck to shoot the Devils if they should leap from the tree,
which was close to the bank.  He manned ten oars a side, and bade them
watch his hand to row in or back out, and so coaxed he them toward the
bank.  But none would set foot ashore, though the gold was within ten
paces.  No man is hasty to his hanging! They whimpered at their oars
like beaten hounds, and Witta bit his fingers for rage.
</P>

<P>
'Said Hugh of a sudden, "Hark!" At first we thought it was the buzzing
of the glittering flies on the water; but it grew loud and fierce, so
that all men heard.'
</P>

<P>
'What?' said Dan and Una.
</P>

<P>
'It was the Sword.'  Sir Richard patted the smooth hilt. 'It sang as a
Dane sings before battle.  "I go," said Hugh, and he leaped from the
bows and fell among the gold.  I was afraid to my four bones' marrow,
but for shame's sake I followed, and Thorkild of Borkum leaped after
me. None other came.  "Blame me not," cried Witta behind us, "I must
abide by my ship." We three had no time to blame or praise.  We stooped
to the gold and threw it back over our shoulders, one hand on our
swords and one eye on the tree, which nigh overhung us.
</P>

<P>
'I know not how the Devils leaped down, or how the fight began.  I
heard Hugh cry:  "Out!  out!" as though he were at Santlache again; I
saw Thorkild's steel cap smitten off his head by a great hairy hand,
and I felt an arrow from the ship whistle past my ear.  They say that
till Witta took his sword to the rowers he could not bring his ship
inshore; and each one of the four archers said afterwards that he alone
had pierced the Devil that fought me.  I do not know.  I went to it in
my mail-shirt, which saved my skin.  With long-sword and belt-dagger I
fought for the life against a Devil whose very feet were hands, and who
whirled me back and forth like a dead branch.  He had me by the waist,
my arms to my side, when an arrow from the ship pierced him between the
shoulders, and he loosened grip.  I passed my sword twice through him,
and he crutched himself away between his long arms, coughing and
moaning.  Next, as I remember, I saw Thorkild of Borkum, bare-headed
and smiling, leaping up and down before a Devil that leaped and gnashed
his teeth.  Then Hugh passed, his sword shifted to his left hand, and I
wondered why I had not known that Hugh was a left-handed man; and
thereafter I remembered nothing till I felt spray on my face, and we
were in sunshine on the open sea.  That was twenty days after.'
</P>

<P>
'What had happened?  Did Hugh die?'the children asked.
</P>

<P>
'Never was such a fight fought by christened man,' said Sir Richard.
'An arrow from the ship had saved me from my Devil, and Thorkild of
Borkum had given back before his Devil, till the bowmen on the ship
could shoot it all full of arrows from near by; but Hugh's Devil was
cunning, and had kept behind trees, where no arrow could reach.  Body
to body there, by stark strength of sword and hand, had Hugh slain him,
and, dying, the Thing had clenched his teeth on the sword.  Judge what
teeth they were!'
</P>

<P>
Sir Richard turned the sword again that the children might see the two
great chiselled gouges on either side of the blade.
</P>

<P>
'Those same teeth met in Hugh's right arm and side,' Sir Richard went
on.  'I?  Oh, I had no more than a broken foot and a fever.  Thorkild's
ear was bitten, but Hugh's arm and side clean withered away.  I saw him
where he lay along, sucking a fruit in his left hand.  His flesh was
wasted off his bones, his hair was patched with white, and his hand was
blue-veined like a woman's.  He put his left arm round my neck and
whispered, "Take my sword. It has been thine since Hastings, O my
brother, but I can never hold hilt again." We lay there on the high
deck talking of Santlache, and, I think, of every day since Santlache,
and it came so that we both wept.  I was weak, and he little more than
a shadow.
</P>

<P>
"'Nay&mdash;nay," said Witta, at the helm-rail.  "Gold is a good right arm
to any man.  Look&mdash;look at the gold!" He bade Thorkild show us the gold
and the elephants' teeth, as though we had been children.  He had
brought away all the gold on the bank, and twice as much more, that the
people of the village gave him for slaying the Devils. They worshipped
us as Gods, Thorkild told me:  it was one of their old women healed up
Hugh's poor arm.'
</P>

<P>
'How much gold did you get?'asked Dan. 'How can I say?  Where we came
out with wedges of iron under the rowers' feet we returned with wedges
of gold hidden beneath planks.  There was dust of gold in packages
where we slept and along the side, and cross-wise under the benches we
lashed the blackened elephants' teeth.
</P>

<P>
"'I had sooner have my right arm," said Hugh, when he had seen all.
</P>

<P>
"'Ahai!  That was my fault," said Witta.  "I should have taken ransom
and landed you in France when first you came aboard, ten months ago."
</P>

<P>
"'It is over-late now," said Hugh, laughing.
</P>

<P>
'Witta plucked at his long shoulder-lock.  "But think!" said he.  "If I
had let ye go&mdash;which I swear I would never have done, for I love ye
more than brothers&mdash;if I had let ye go, by now ye might have been
horribly slain by some mere Moor in the Duke of Burgundy's war, or ye
might have been murdered by land-thieves, or ye might have died of the
plague at an inn.  Think of this and do not blame me overmuch, Hugh.
See!  I will only take a half of the gold."
</P>

<P>
"'I blame thee not at all, Witta," said Hugh.  "It was a joyous
venture, and we thirty-five here have done what never men have done.
If I live till England, I will build me a stout keep over Dallington
out of my share."
</P>

<P>
"'I will buy cattle and amber and warm red cloth for the wife," said
Witta, "and I will hold all the land at the head of Stavanger Fiord.
Many will fight for me now.  But first we must turn North, and with
this honest treasure aboard I pray we meet no pirate ships."
</P>

<P>
'We did not laugh.  We were careful.  We were afraid lest we should
lose one grain of our gold, for which we had fought Devils.
</P>

<P>
"'Where is the Sorcerer?" said I, for Witta was looking at the Wise
Iron in the box, and I could not see the Yellow Man.
</P>

<P>
"'He has gone to his own country," said he.  "He rose up in the night
while we were beating out of that forest in the mud, and said that he
could see it behind the trees. He leaped out on the mud, and did not
answer when we called; so we called no more.  He left the Wise Iron,
which is all that I care for&mdash;and see, the Spirit still points to the
South."
</P>

<P>
'We were troubled for fear that the Wise Iron should fail us now that
its Yellow Man had gone, and when we saw the Spirit still served us we
grew afraid of too strong winds, and of shoals, and of careless leaping
fish, and of all the people on all the shores where we landed.'
</P>

<P>
'Why?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Because of the gold&mdash;because of our gold.  Gold changes men
altogether.  Thorkild of Borkum did not change.  He laughed at Witta
for his fears, and at us for our counselling Witta to furl sail when
the ship pitched at all.
</P>

<P>
"'Better be drowned out of hand," said Thorkild of Borkum, "than go
tied to a deck-load of yellow dust."
</P>

<P>
'He was a landless man, and had been slave to some King in the East.
He would have beaten out the gold into deep bands to put round the
oars, and round the prow.
</P>

<P>
'Yet, though he vexed himself for the gold, Witta waited upon Hugh like
a woman, lending him his shoulder when the ship rolled, and tying of
ropes from side to side that Hugh might hold by them.  But for Hugh, he
said&mdash;and so did all his men&mdash;they would never have won the gold.  I
remember Witta made a little, thin gold ring for our Bird to swing in.
</P>

<P>
'Three months we rowed and sailed and went ashore for fruits or to
clean the ship.  When we saw wild horsemen, riding among sand-dunes,
flourishing spears, we knew we were on the Moors' coast, and stood over
north to Spain; and a strong south-west wind bore us in ten days to a
coast of high red rocks, where we heard a hunting-horn blow among the
yellow gorse and knew it was England.
</P>

<P>
"'Now find ye Pevensey yourselves," said Witta.  "I love not these
narrow ship-filled seas."
</P>

<P>
'He set the dried, salted head of the Devil, which Hugh had killed,
high on our prow, and all boats fled from us. Yet, for our gold's sake,
we were more afraid than they. We crept along the coast by night till
we came to the chalk cliffs, and so east to Pevensey.  Witta would not
come ashore with us, though Hugh promised him wine at Dallington enough
to swim in.  He was on fire to see his wife, and ran into the Marsh
after sunset, and there he left us and our share of gold, and backed
out on the same tide.  He made no promise; he swore no oath; he looked
for no thanks; but to Hugh, an armless man, and to me, an old cripple
whom he could have flung into the sea, he passed over wedge upon wedge,
packet upon packet of gold and dust of gold, and only ceased when we
would take no more.  As he stooped from the rail to bid us farewell he
stripped off his right-arm bracelets and put them all on Hugh's left,
and he kissed Hugh on the cheek.  I think when Thorkild of Borkum bade
the rowers give way we were near weeping.  It is true that Witta was an
heathen and a pirate; true it is he held us by force many months in his
ship, but I loved that bow-legged, blue-eyed man for his great
boldness, his cunning, his skill, and, beyond all, for his simplicity.'
</P>

<P>
'Did he get home all right?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'I never knew.  We saw him hoist sail under the moon-track and stand
away.  I have prayed that he found his wife and the children.'
</P>

<P>
'And what did you do?'
</P>

<P>
'We waited on the Marsh till the day.  Then I sat by the gold, all tied
in an old sail, while Hugh went to Pevensey, and De Aquila sent us
horses.'
</P>

<P>
Sir Richard crossed hands on his sword-hilt, and stared down stream
through the soft warm shadows.
</P>

<P>
'A whole shipload of gold!' said Una, looking at the little Golden
Hind.  'But I'm glad I didn't see the Devils.'
</P>

<P>
'I don't believe they were Devils,'Dan whispered back.
</P>

<P>
'Eh?' said Sir Richard.  'Witta's father warned him they were
unquestionable Devils.  One must believe one's father, and not one's
children.  What were my Devils, then?'
</P>

<P>
Dan flushed all over.  'I&mdash;I only thought,' he stammered; 'I've got a
book called The Gorilla Hunters&mdash;it's a continuation of Coral Island,
sir&mdash;and it says there that the gorillas (they're big monkeys, you
know) were always chewing iron up.'
</P>

<P>
'Not always,' said Una.  'Only twice.'  They had been reading The
Gorilla Hunters in the orchard.
</P>

<P>
'Well, anyhow, they always drummed on their chests, like Sir Richard's
did, before they went for people.  And they built houses in trees, too.'
</P>

<P>
'Ha!'  Sir Richard opened his eyes.  'Houses like flat nests did our
Devils make, where their imps lay and looked at us.  I did not see them
(I was sick after the fight), but Witta told me, and, lo, ye know it
also?  Wonderful! Were our Devils only nest-building apes?  Is there no
sorcery left in the world?'
</P>

<P>
'I don't know,' answered Dan, uncomfortably.  'I've seen a man take
rabbits out of a hat, and he told us we could see how he did it, if we
watched hard.  And we did.'
</P>

<P>
'But we didn't,' said Una, sighing.  'Oh!  there's Puck!'
</P>

<P>
The little fellow, brown and smiling, peered between two stems of an
ash, nodded, and slid down the bank into the cool beside them.
</P>

<P>
'No sorcery, Sir Richard?' he laughed, and blew on a full dandelion
head he had picked.
</P>

<P>
'They tell me that Witta's Wise Iron was a toy.  The boy carries such
an iron with him.  They tell me our Devils were apes, called gorillas!'
said Sir Richard, indignantly.
</P>

<P>
'That is the sorcery of books,' said Puck.  'I warned thee they were
wise children.  All people can be wise by reading of books.'
</P>

<P>
'But are the books true?'  Sir Richard frowned.  'I like not all this
reading and writing.' 'Ye-es,' said Puck, holding the naked dandelion
head at arm's length.  'But if we hang all fellows who write falsely,
why did De Aquila not begin with Gilbert the Clerk?  He was false
enough.'
</P>

<P>
'Poor false Gilbert.  Yet, in his fashion, he was bold,' said Sir
Richard.
</P>

<P>
'What did he do?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'He wrote,' said Sir Richard.  'Is the tale meet for children, think
you?'  He looked at Puck; but 'Tell us!  Tell us!' cried Dan and Una
together.

OLD MEN AT PEVENSEY

<BR>

<P>
'It has naught to do with apes or Devils,'Sir Richard went on, in an
undertone.  'It concerns De Aquila, than whom there was never bolder
nor craftier, nor more hardy knight born.  And remember he was an old,
old man at that time.'
</P>

<P>
'When?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'When we came back from sailing with Witta.'
</P>

<P>
'What did you do with your gold?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Have patience.  Link by link is chain-mail made.  I will tell all in
its place.  We bore the gold to Pevensey on horseback&mdash;three loads of
it&mdash;and then up to the north chamber, above the Great Hall of Pevensey
Castle, where De Aquila lay in winter.  He sat on his bed like a little
white falcon, turning his head swiftly from one to the other as we told
our tale.  Jehan the Crab, an old sour man-at-arms, guarded the
stairway, but De Aquila bade him wait at the stair-foot, and let down
both leather curtains over the door.  It was jehan whom De Aquila had
sent to us with the horses, and only Jehan had loaded the gold.  When
our story was told, De Aquila gave us the news of England, for we were
as men waked from a year-long sleep.  The Red King was dead&mdash;slain (ye
remember?) the day we set sail&mdash;and Henry, his younger brother, had
made himself King of England over the head of Robert of Normandy.  This
was the very thing that the Red King had done to Robert when our Great
William died.  Then Robert of Normandy, mad, as De Aquila said, at
twice missing of this kingdom, had sent an army against England, which
army had been well beaten back to their ships at Portsmouth.  A little
earlier, and Witta's ship would have rowed through them.
</P>

<P>
"'And now," said De Aquila, "half the great Barons of the North and
West are out against the King between Salisbury and Shrewsbury, and
half the other half wait to see which way the game shall go.  They say
Henry is overly English for their stomachs, because he hath married an
English wife and she hath coaxed him to give back their old laws to our
Saxons.  (Better ride a horse on the bit he knows, I say!) But that is
only a cloak to their falsehood." He cracked his finger on the table,
where the wine was spilt, and thus he spoke:
</P>

<P>
"'William crammed us Norman barons full of good English acres after
Santlache.  I had my share too," he said, and clapped Hugh on the
shoulder; "but I warned him&mdash;I warned him before Odo rebelled&mdash;that he
should have bidden the Barons give up their lands and lordships in
Normandy if they would be English lords.  Now they are all but princes
both in England and Normandy&mdash;trencher-fed hounds, with a foot in one
trough and both eyes on the other!  Robert of Normandy has sent them
word that if they do not fight for him in England he will sack and
harry out their lands in Normandy.  Therefore Clare has risen,
FitzOsborne has risen, Montgomery has risen&mdash;whom our First William
made an English Earl. Even D'Arcy is out with his men, whose father I
remember&mdash;a little hedge-sparrow knight near by Caen.  If Henry wins,
the Barons can still flee to Normandy, where Robert will welcome them.
If Henry loses, Robert, he says, will give them more lands in England.
Oh, a pest&mdash;a pest on Normandy, for she will be our England's curse
this many a long year!"
</P>

<P>
"'Amen," said Hugh.  "But will the war come our ways, think you?"
</P>

<P>
"'Not from the North," said De Aquila.  "But the sea is always open.
If the Barons gain the upper hand Robert will send another army into
England for sure, and this time I think he will land here&mdash;where his
father, the Conqueror, landed.  Ye have brought your pigs to a pretty
market!  Half England alight, and gold enough on the ground"&mdash;he
stamped on the bars beneath the table&mdash;"to set every sword in
Christendom fighting."
</P>

<P>
"'What is to do?" said Hugh.  "I have no keep at Dallington; and if we
buried it, whom could we trust?" "'Me," said De Aquila.  "Pevensey
walls are strong.  No man but jehan, who is my dog, knows what is
between them." He drew a curtain by the shot-window and showed us the
shaft of a well in the thickness of the wall.
</P>

<P>
"'I made it for a drinking-well," he said, "but we found salt water,
and it rises and falls with the tide.  Hark!" We heard the water
whistle and blow at the bottom.  "Will it serve?" said he.
</P>

<P>
"'Needs must," said Hugh.  "Our lives are in thy hands." So we lowered
all the gold down except one small chest of it by De Aquila's bed,
which we kept as much for his delight in its weight and colour as for
any of our needs.
</P>

<P>
'In the morning, ere we rode to our Manors, he said:  "I do not say
farewell; because ye will return and bide here. Not for love nor for
sorrow, but to be with the gold.  Have a care," he said, laughing,
"lest I use it to make myself Pope.  Trust me not, but return!"'
</P>

<P>
Sir Richard paused and smiled sadly.
</P>

<P>
'In seven days, then, we returned from our Manors&mdash;from the Manors
which had been ours.'
</P>

<P>
'And were the children quite well?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'My sons were young.  Land and governance belong by right to young
men.'  Sir Richard was talking to himself. 'It would have broken their
hearts if we had taken back our Manors.  They made us great welcome,
but we could see&mdash;Hugh and I could see&mdash;that our day was done.  I was a
cripple and he a one-armed man.  No!'  He shook his head.  'And
therefore'&mdash;he raised his voice&mdash;'we rode back to Pevensey.'
</P>

<P>
'I'm sorry,' said Una, for the knight seemed very sorrowful.
</P>

<P>
'Little maid, it all passed long ago.  They were young; we were old.
We let them rule the Manors.  "Aha!" cried De Aquila from his
shot-window, when we dismounted. "Back again to earth, old foxes?" but
when we were in his chamber above the Hall he puts his arms about us
and says, "Welcome, ghosts!  Welcome, poor ghosts!"
</P>

<P>
Thus it fell out that we were rich beyond belief, and lonely.  And
lonely!'
</P>

<P>
'What did you do?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'We watched for Robert of Normandy,' said the knight. 'De Aquila was
like Witta.  He suffered no idleness.  In fair weather we would ride
along between Bexlei on the one side, to Cuckmere on the
other&mdash;sometimes with hawk, sometimes with hound (there are stout hares
both on the Marsh and the Downland), but always with an eye to the sea,
for fear of fleets from Normandy.  In foul weather he would walk on the
top of his tower, frowning against the rain&mdash;peering here and pointing
there.  It always vexed him to think how Witta's ship had come and gone
without his knowledge.  When the wind ceased and ships anchored, to the
wharf's edge he would go and, leaning on his sword among the stinking
fish, would call to the mariners for their news from France.  His other
eye he kept landward for word of Henry's war against the Barons.
</P>

<P>
'Many brought him news&mdash;jongleurs, harpers, pedlars, sutlers, priests
and the like; and, though he was secret enough in small things, yet, if
their news misliked him, then, regarding neither time nor place nor
people, he would curse our King Henry for a fool or a babe.  I have
heard him cry aloud by the fishing boats:  "If I were King of England I
would do thus and thus"; and when I rode out to see that the
warning-beacons were laid and dry, he hath often called to me from the
shot-window:  "Look to it, Richard!  Do not copy our blind King, but
see with thine own eyes and feel with thine own hands." I do not think
he knew any sort of fear.  And so we lived at Pevensey, in the little
chamber above the Hall.
</P>

<P>
'One foul night came word that a messenger of the King waited below.
We were chilled after a long riding in the fog towards Bexlei, which is
an easy place for ships to land.  De Aquila sent word the man might
either eat with us or wait till we had fed.  Anon jehan, at the
stair-head, cried that he had called for horse, and was gone.  "Pest on
him!" said De Aquila.  "I have more to do than to shiver in the Great
Hall for every gadling the King sends.  Left he no word?"
</P>

<P>
"'None," said Jehan, "except"&mdash;he had been with De Aquila at
Santlache&mdash;"except he said that if an old dog could not learn new
tricks it was time to sweep out the kennel."
</P>

<P>
"'Oho!" said De Aquila, rubbing his nose, "to whom did he say that?"
</P>

<P>
"'To his beard, chiefly, but some to his horse's flank as he was
girthing up.  I followed him out," said jehan the Crab.
</P>

<P>
"'What was his shield-mark?"
</P>

<P>
"'Gold horseshoes on black," said the Crab.
</P>

<P>
"'That is one of Fulke's men," said De Aquila.'
</P>

<P>
Puck broke in very gently, 'Gold horseshoes on black is not the Fulkes'
shield.  The Fulkes' arms are&mdash;'
</P>

<P>
The knight waved one hand statelily.
</P>

<P>
'Thou knowest that evil man's true name,' he replied, 'but I have
chosen to call him Fulke because I promised him I would not tell the
story of his wickedness so that any man might guess it.  I have changed
all the names in my tale.  His children's children may be still alive.'
</P>

<P>
'True&mdash;true,' said Puck, smiling softly.  'It is knightly to keep
faith&mdash;even after a thousand years.'
</P>

<P>
Sir Richard bowed a little and went on:
</P>

<P>
"'Gold horseshoes on black?" said De Aquila.  "I had heard Fulke had
joined the Barons, but if this is true our King must be of the upper
hand.  No matter, all Fulkes are faithless.  Still, I would not have
sent the man away empty."
</P>

<P>
"'He fed," said jehan.  "Gilbert the Clerk fetched him meat and wine
from the kitchens.  He ate at Gilbert's table."
</P>

<P>
'This Gilbert was a clerk from Battle Abbey, who kept the accounts of
the Manor of Pevensey.  He was tall and pale-coloured, and carried
those new-fashioned beads for counting of prayers.  They were large
brown nuts or seeds, and hanging from his girdle with his pen and
ink-horn they clashed when he walked.  His place was in the great
fireplace.  There was his table of accounts, and there he lay o'
nights.  He feared the hounds in the Hall that came nosing after bones
or to sleep on the warm ashes, and would slash at them with his
beads&mdash;like a woman.  When De Aquila sat in Hall to do justice, take
fines, or grant lands, Gilbert would so write it in the Manor-roll.
But it was none of his work to feed our guests, or to let them depart
without his lord's knowledge.
</P>

<P>
'Said De Aquila, after jehan was gone down the stair: "Hugh, hast thou
ever told my Gilbert thou canst read Latin hand-of-write?"
</P>

<P>
"'No," said Hugh.  "He is no friend to me, or to Odo my hound either."
</P>

<P>
"'No matter," said De Aquila.  "Let him never know thou canst tell one
letter from its fellow, and"&mdash;there he yerked us in the ribs with his
scabbard&mdash;"watch him, both of ye.  There be devils in Africa, as I have
heard, but by the Saints, there be greater devils in Pevensey!" And
that was all he would say.
</P>

<P>
'It chanced, some small while afterwards, a Norman man-at-arms would
wed a Saxon wench of the Manor, and Gilbert (we had watched him well
since De Aquila spoke) doubted whether her folk were free or slave.
Since De Aquila would give them a field of good land, if she were free,
the matter came up at the justice in Great Hall before De Aquila.
First the wench's father spoke; then her mother; then all together,
till the Hall rang and the hounds bayed.  De Aquila held up his hands.
"Write her free," he called to Gilbert by the fireplace.  "A' God's
name write her free, before she deafens me!  Yes, yes," he said to the
wench that was on her knees at him; "thou art Cerdic's sister, and own
cousin to the Lady of Mercia, if thou wilt be silent.  In fifty years
there will be neither Norman nor Saxon, but all English," said he, "and
these are the men that do our work!" He clapped the man-at-arms that
was Jehan's nephew on the shoulder, and kissed the wench, and fretted
with his feet among the rushes to show it was finished.  (The Great
Hall is always bitter cold.) I stood at his side; Hugh was behind
Gilbert in the fireplace making to play with wise rough Odo.  He signed
to De Aquila, who bade Gilbert measure the new field for the new
couple.  Out then runs our Gilbert between man and maid, his beads
clashing at his waist, and the Hall being empty, we three sit by the
fire.
</P>

<P>
'Said Hugh, leaning down to the hearthstones, "I saw this stone move
under Gilbert's foot when Odo snuffed at it.  Look!" De Aquila digged
in the ashes with his sword; the stone tilted; beneath it lay a
parchment folden, and the writing atop was:  "Words spoken against the
King by our Lord of Pevensey&mdash;the second part."
</P>

<P>
'Here was set out (Hugh read it us whispering) every jest De Aquila had
made to us touching the King; every time he had called out to me from
the shot-window, and every time he had said what he would do if he were
King of England.  Yes, day by day had his daily speech, which he never
stinted, been set down by Gilbert, tricked out and twisted from its
true meaning, yet withal so cunningly that none could deny who knew him
that De Aquila had in some sort spoken those words.  Ye see?'
</P>

<P>
Dan and Una nodded.
</P>

<P>
'Yes,' said Una gravely.  'It isn't what you say so much. It's what you
mean when you say it.  Like calling Dan a beast in fun.  Only grown-ups
don't always understand.'
</P>

<P>
"'He hath done this day by day before our very face?" said De Aquila.
</P>

<P>
"'Nay, hour by hour," said Hugh.  "When De Aquila spoke even now, in
the Hall, of Saxons and Normans, I saw Gilbert write on a parchment,
which he kept beside the Manor-roll, that De Aquila said soon there
would be no Normans left in England if his men-at-arms did their work
aright."
</P>

<P>
"'Bones of the Saints!" said De Aquila.  "What avail is honour or a
sword against a pen?  Where did Gilbert hide that writing?  He shall
eat it."
</P>

<P>
"'In his breast when he ran out," said Hugh.  "Which made me look to
see where he kept his finished stuff. When Odo scratched at this stone
here, I saw his face change.  So I was sure."
</P>

<P>
"'He is bold," said De Aquila.  "Do him justice.  In his own fashion,
my Gilbert is bold."
</P>

<P>
"'Overbold," said Hugh.  "Hearken here," and he read:  "Upon the Feast
of St Agatha, our Lord of Pevensey, lying in his upper chamber, being
clothed in his second fur gown reversed with rabbit&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"'Pest on him!  He is not my tire-woman!" said De Aquila, and Hugh and
I laughed. "'Reversed with rabbit, seeing a fog over the marshes, did
wake Sir Richard Dalyngridge, his drunken cup-mate" (here they laughed
at me) "and said, 'Peer out, old fox, for God is on the Duke of
Normandy's side."'
</P>

<P>
"'So did I.  It was a black fog.  Robert could have landed ten thousand
men, and we none the wiser.  Does he tell how we were out all day
riding the Marsh, and how I near perished in a quicksand, and coughed
like a sick ewe for ten days after?" cried De Aquila.
</P>

<P>
"'No," said Hugh.  "But here is the prayer of Gilbert himself to his
master Fulke."
</P>

<P>
"'Ah," said De Aquila.  "Well I knew it was Fulke. What is the price of
my blood?"
</P>

<P>
"'Gilbert prayeth that when our Lord of Pevensey is stripped of his
lands on this evidence which Gilbert hath, with fear and pains,
collected&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"'Fear and pains is a true word," said De Aquila, and sucked in his
cheeks.  "But how excellent a weapon is a pen!  I must learn it."
</P>

<P>
"'He prays that Fulke will advance him from his present service to that
honour in the Church which Fulke promised him.  And lest Fulke should
forget, he has written below, 'To be Sacristan of Battle'."
</P>

<P>
'At this De Aquila whistled.  "A man who can plot against one lord can
plot against another.  When I am stripped of my lands Fulke will whip
off my Gilbert's foolish head.  None the less Battle needs a new
Sacristan. They tell me the Abbot Henry keeps no sort of rule there."
</P>

<P>
"'Let the Abbot wait," said Hugh.  "It is our heads and our lands that
are in danger.  This parchment is the second part of the tale.  The
first has gone to Fulke, and so to the King, who will hold us traitors."
</P>

<P>
"Assuredly," said De Aquila.  "Fulke's man took the first part that
evening when Gilbert fed him, and our King is so beset by his brother
and his Barons (small blame, too!) that he is mad with mistrust.  Fulke
has his ear, and pours poison into it.  Presently the King gives him my
land and yours.  This is old," and he leaned back and yawned.
</P>

<P>
"'And thou wilt surrender Pevensey without word or blow?" said Hugh.
"We Saxons will fight your King then. I will go warn my nephew at
Dallington.  Give me a horse!"
</P>

<P>
"'Give thee a toy and a rattle," said De Aquila.  "Put back the
parchment, and rake over the ashes.  If Fulke is given my Pevensey,
which is England's gate, what will he do with it?  He is Norman at
heart, and his heart is in Normandy, where he can kill peasants at his
pleasure. He will open England's gate to our sleepy Robert, as Odo and
Mortain tried to do, and then there will be another landing and another
Santlache.  Therefore I cannot give up Pevensey."
</P>

<P>
"'Good," said we two.
</P>

<P>
"'Ah, but wait!  If my King be made, on Gilbert's evidence, to mistrust
me, he will send his men against me here, and while we fight, England's
gate is left unguarded.  Who will be the first to come through thereby?
Even Robert of Normandy.  Therefore I cannot fight my King." He nursed
his sword&mdash;thus.
</P>

<P>
"'This is saying and unsaying like a Norman," said Hugh.  "What of our
Manors?"
</P>

<P>
"'I do not think for myself," said De Aquila, "nor for our King, nor
for your lands.  I think for England, for whom neither King nor Baron
thinks.  I am not Norman, Sir Richard, nor Saxon, Sir Hugh.  English am
I."
</P>

<P>
"'Saxon, Norman or English," said Hugh, "our lives are thine, however
the game goes.  When do we hang Gilbert?"
</P>

<P>
"'Never," said De Aquila.  "Who knows, he may yet be Sacristan of
Battle, for, to do him justice, he is a good writer.  Dead men make
dumb witnesses.  Wait."
</P>

<P>
"'But the King may give Pevensey to Fulke.  And our Manors go with it,"
said I.  "Shall we tell our sons?"
</P>

<P>
"'No.  The King will not wake up a hornets' nest in the South till he
has smoked out the bees in the North.  He may hold me a traitor; but at
least he sees I am not fighting against him; and every day that I lie
still is so much gain to him while he fights the Barons.  If he were
wise he would wait till that war were over before he made new enemies.
But I think Fulke will play upon him to send for me, and if I do not
obey the summons, that will, to Henry's mind, be proof of my treason.
But mere talk, such as Gilbert sends, is no proof nowadays.  We Barons
follow the Church, and, like Anselm, we speak what we please.  Let us
go about our day's dealings, and say naught to Gilbert."
</P>

<P>
"'Then we do nothing?" said Hugh.
</P>

<P>
"'We wait," said De Aquila.  "I am old, but still I find that the most
grievous work I know." 'And so we found it, but in the end De Aquila
was right.
</P>

<P>
'A little later in the year, armed men rode over the hill, the Golden
Horseshoes flying behind the King's banner. Said De Aquila, at the
window of our chamber:  "How did I tell you?  Here comes Fulke himself
to spy out his new lands which our King hath promised him if he can
bring proof of my treason."
</P>

<P>
"'How dost thou know?" said Hugh.
</P>

<P>
"'Because that is what I would do if I were Fulke, but I should have
brought more men.  My roan horse to your old shoes," said he, "Fulke
brings me the King's Summons to leave Pevensey and join the war." He
sucked in his cheeks and drummed on the edge of the well-shaft, where
the water sounded all hollow.
</P>

<P>
"'Shall we go?" said I.
</P>

<P>
"'Go!  At this time of year?  Stark madness," said he. "Take me from
Pevensey to fisk and flyte through fern and forest, and in three days
Robert's keels would be lying on Pevensey mud with ten thousand men!
Who would stop them&mdash;Fulke?"
</P>

<P>
'The horns blew without, and anon Fulke cried the King's Summons at the
great door, that De Aquila with all men and horse should join the
King's camp at Salisbury. "'How did I tell you?" said De Aquila.
"There are twenty Barons 'twixt here and Salisbury could give King
Henry good land service, but he has been worked upon by Fulke to send
South and call me&mdash;me!&mdash;-off the Gate of England, when his enemies
stand about to batter it in. See that Fulke's men lie in the big south
barn," said he. "Give them drink, and when Fulke has eaten we will
drink in my chamber.  The Great Hall is too cold for old bones."
</P>

<P>
'As soon as he was off-horse Fulke went to the chapel with Gilbert to
give thanks for his safe coming, and when he had eaten&mdash;he was a fat
man, and rolled his eyes greedily at our good roast Sussex
wheat-ears&mdash;we led him to the little upper chamber, whither Gilbert had
already gone with the Manor-roll.  I remember when Fulke heard the tide
blow and whistle in the shaft he leaped back, and his long down-turned
stirrup-shoes caught in the rushes and he stumbled, so that Jehan
behind him found it easy to knock his head against the wall.'
</P>

<P>
'Did you know it was going to happen?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Assuredly,' said Sir Richard, with a sweet smile.  'I put my foot on
his sword and plucked away his dagger, but he knew not whether it was
day or night for awhile.  He lay rolling his eyes and bubbling with his
mouth, and jehan roped him like a calf.  He was cased all in that
newfangled armour which we call lizard-mail.  Not rings like my hauberk
here'&mdash;Sir Richard tapped his chest&mdash;but little pieces of dagger-proof
steel overlapping on stout leather.  We stripped it off (no need to
spoil good harness by wetting it), and in the neck-piece De Aquila
found the same folden piece of parchment which we had put back under
the hearth-stone.
</P>

<P>
'At this Gilbert would have run out.  I laid my hand on his shoulder.
It sufficed.  He fell to trembling and praying on his beads.
</P>

<P>
"'Gilbert," said De Aquila, "here be more notable sayings and doings of
our Lord of Pevensey for thee to write down.  Take pen and ink-horn,
Gilbert.  We cannot all be Sacristans of Battle."
</P>

<P>
'Said Fulke from the floor, "Ye have bound a King's messenger.
Pevensey shall burn for this."
</P>

<P>
"'Maybe.  I have seen it besieged once," said De Aquila, "but heart up,
Fulke.  I promise thee that thou shalt be hanged in the middle of the
flames at the end of that siege, if I have to share my last loaf with
thee; and that is more than Odo would have done when we starved out him
and Mortain."
</P>

<P>
'Then Fulke sat up and looked long and cunningly at De Aquila.
</P>

<P>
"'By the Saints," said he, "why didst thou not say thou wast on the
Duke Robert's side at the first?"
</P>

<P>
"'Am I?" said De Aquila.
</P>

<P>
'Fulke laughed and said, "No man who serves King Henry dare do this
much to his messenger.  When didst thou come over to the Duke?  Let me
up and we can smooth it out together." And he smiled and becked and
winked.
</P>

<P>
"'Yes, we will smooth it out," said De Aquila.  He nodded to me, and
jehan and I heaved up Fulke&mdash;he was a heavy man&mdash;and lowered him into
the shaft by a rope, not so as to stand on our gold, but dangling by
his shoulders a little above.  It was turn of ebb, and the water came
to his knees.  He said nothing, but shivered somewhat.
</P>

<P>
'Then jehan of a sudden beat down Gilbert's wrist with his sheathed
dagger.  "Stop!" he said.  "He swallows his beads."
</P>

<P>
"'Poison, belike," said De Aquila.  "It is good for men who know too
much.  I have carried it these thirty years. Give me!"
</P>

<P>
'Then Gilbert wept and howled.  De Aquila ran the beads through his
fingers.  The last one&mdash;I have said they were large nuts&mdash;opened in two
halves on a pin, and there was a small folded parchment within.  On it
was written: "The Old Dog goes to Salisbury to be beaten.  I have his
Kennel. Come quickly.
</P>

<P>
"'This is worse than poison," said De Aquila very softly, and sucked in
his cheeks.  Then Gilbert grovelled in the rushes, and told us all he
knew.  The letter, as we guessed, was from Fulke to the Duke (and not
the first that had passed between them); Fulke had given it to Gilbert
in the chapel, and Gilbert thought to have taken it by morning to a
certain fishing boat at the wharf, which trafficked between Pevensey
and the French shore.  Gilbert was a false fellow, but he found time
between his quakings and shakings to swear that the master of the boat
knew nothing of the matter.
</P>

<P>
"'He hath called me shaved-head," said Gilbert, "and he hath thrown
haddock-guts at me; but for all that, he is no traitor."
</P>

<P>
"'I will have no clerk of mine mishandled or miscalled," said De
Aquila.  "That seaman shall be whipped at his own mast.  Write me first
a letter, and thou shalt bear it, with the order for the whipping,
tomorrow to the boat."
</P>

<P>
'At this Gilbert would have kissed De Aquila's hand&mdash;he had not hoped
to live until the morning&mdash;and when he trembled less he wrote a letter
as from Fulke to the Duke, saying that the Kennel, which signified
Pevensey, was shut, and that the Old Dog (which was De Aquila) sat
outside it, and, moreover, that all had been betrayed.
</P>

<P>
"'Write to any man that all is betrayed," said De Aquila, "and even the
Pope himself would sleep uneasily.  Eh, Jehan?  If one told thee all
was betrayed, what wouldst thou do?"
</P>

<P>
"'I would run away," said Jehan.  "It might be true."
</P>

<P>
"'Well said," quoth De Aquila.  "Write, Gilbert, that Montgomery, the
great Earl, hath made his peace with the King, and that little D'Arcy,
whom I hate, hath been hanged by the heels.  We will give Robert full
measure to chew upon.  Write also that Fulke himself is sick to death
of a dropsy."
</P>

<P>
"'Nay!" cried Fulke, hanging in the well-shaft. "Drown me out of hand,
but do not make a jest of me."
</P>

<P>
"'Jest?  I?" said De Aquila.  "I am but fighting for life and lands
with a pen, as thou hast shown me, Fulke."
</P>

<P>
'Then Fulke groaned, for he was cold, and, "Let me confess," said he.
</P>

<P>
"'Now, this is right neighbourly," said De Aquila, leaning over the
shaft.  "Thou hast read my sayings and doings&mdash;or at least the first
part of them&mdash;and thou art minded to repay me with thy own doings and
sayings.  Take pen and inkhorn, Gilbert.  Here is work that will not
irk thee."
</P>

<P>
"'Let my men go without hurt, and I will confess my treason against the
King," said Fulke.
</P>

<P>
"'Now, why has he grown so tender of his men of a sudden?" said Hugh to
me; for Fulke had no name for mercy to his men.  Plunder he gave them,
but pity, none.
</P>

<P>
"'Te!  Te!" said De Aquila.  "Thy treason was all confessed long ago by
Gilbert.  It would be enough to hang Montgomery himself."
</P>

<P>
"'Nay; but spare my men," said Fulke; and we heard him splash like a
fish in a pond, for the tide was rising.
</P>

<P>
"'All in good time," said De Aquila.  "The night is young; the wine is
old; and we need only the merry tale. Begin the story of thy life since
when thou wast a lad at Tours.  Tell it nimbly!"
</P>

<P>
"'Ye shame me to my soul," said Fulke.
</P>

<P>
"'Then I have done what neither King nor Duke could do," said De
Aquila.  "But begin, and forget nothing."
</P>

<P>
"'Send thy man away," said Fulke.
</P>

<P>
"'That much can I do," said De Aquila.  'But, remember, I am like the
Danes' King.  I cannot turn the tide.'
</P>

<P>
"'How long will it rise?" said Fulke, and splashed anew.
</P>

<P>
"'For three hours," said De Aquila.  "Time to tell all thy good deeds.
Begin, and, Gilbert,&mdash;I have heard thou art somewhat careless&mdash;do not
twist his words from his true meaning."
</P>

<P>
'So&mdash;fear of death in the dark being upon him&mdash;Fulke began, and
Gilbert, not knowing what his fate might be, wrote it word by word.  I
have heard many tales, but never heard I aught to match the tale of
Fulke his black life, as Fulke told it hollowly, hanging in the shaft.'
</P>

<P>
'Was it bad?' said Dan, awestruck. 'Beyond belief,' Sir Richard
answered.  'None the less, there was that in it which forced even
Gilbert to laugh. We three laughed till we ached.  At one place his
teeth so chattered that we could not well hear, and we reached him down
a cup of wine.  Then he warmed to it, and smoothly set out all his
shifts, malices, and treacheries, his extreme boldnesses (he was
desperate bold); his retreats, shufflings, and counterfeitings (he was
also inconceivably a coward); his lack of gear and honour; his despair
at their loss; his remedies, and well-coloured contrivances.  Yes, he
waved the filthy rags of his life before us, as though they had been
some proud banner. When he ceased, we saw by torches that the tide
stood at the corners of his mouth, and he breathed strongly through his
nose.
</P>

<P>
'We had him out, and rubbed him; we wrapped him in a cloak, and gave
him wine, and we leaned and looked upon him, the while he drank.  He
was shivering, but shameless.
</P>

<P>
'Of a sudden we heard jehan at the stairway wake, but a boy pushed past
him, and stood before us, the Hall-rushes in his hair, all slubbered
with sleep.  "My father! My father!  I dreamed of treachery," he cried,
and babbled thickly.
</P>

<P>
"'There is no treachery here," said Fulke.  "Go!" and the boy turned,
even then not fully awake, and jehan led him by the hand to the Great
Hall. "'Thy only son!" said De Aquila.  "Why didst thou bring the child
here?"
</P>

<P>
"'He is my heir.  I dared not trust him to my brother," said Fulke, and
now he was ashamed.  De Aquila said nothing, but sat weighing a
wine-cup in his two hands&mdash;thus.  Anon, Fulke touched him on the knee.
</P>

<P>
"'Let the boy escape to Normandy," said he, "and do with me at thy
pleasure.  Yea, hang me tomorrow, with my letter to Robert round my
neck, but let the boy go."
</P>

<P>
"'Be still," said De Aquila.  "I think for England."
</P>

<P>
'So we waited what our Lord of Pevensey should devise; and the sweat
ran down Fulke's forehead.
</P>

<P>
'At last said De Aquila:  "I am too old to judge, or to trust any man.
I do not covet thy lands, as thou hast coveted mine; and whether thou
art any better or any worse than any other black Angevin thief, it is
for thy King to find out.  Therefore, go back to thy King, Fulke."
</P>

<P>
"'And thou wilt say nothing of what has passed?" said Fulke.
</P>

<P>
"'Why should I?  Thy son will stay with me.  If the King calls me again
to leave Pevensey, which I must guard against England's enemies; if the
King sends his men against me for a traitor; or if I hear that the King
in his bed thinks any evil of me or my two knights, thy son will be
hanged from out this window, Fulke."'
</P>

<P>
'But it hadn't anything to do with his son,' cried Una, startled.
</P>

<P>
'How could we have hanged Fulke?' said Sir Richard. 'We needed him to
make our peace with the King.  He would have betrayed half England for
the boy's sake.  Of that we were sure.'
</P>

<P>
'I don't understand,' said Una.  'But I think it was simply awful.'
</P>

<P>
'So did not Fulke.  He was well pleased.'
</P>

<P>
'What?  Because his son was going to be killed?'
</P>

<P>
'Nay.  Because De Aquila had shown him how he might save the boy's life
and his own lands and honours.  "I will do it," he said.  "I swear I
will do it.  I will tell the King thou art no traitor, but the most
excellent, valiant, and perfect of us all.  Yes, I will save thee."
</P>

<P>
'De Aquila looked still into the bottom of the cup, rolling the
wine-dregs to and fro. "'Ay," he said.  "If I had a son, I would, I
think, save him.  But do not by any means tell me how thou wilt go
about it."
</P>

<P>
"'Nay, nay," said Fulke, nodding his bald head wisely. "That is my
secret.  But rest at ease, De Aquila, no hair of thy head nor rood of
thy land shall be forfeited," and he smiled like one planning great
good deeds.
</P>

<P>
"'And henceforward," said De Aquila, "I counsel thee to serve one
master&mdash;not two."
</P>

<P>
"'What?" said Fulke.  "Can I work no more honest trading between the
two sides these troublous times?"
</P>

<P>
"'Serve Robert or the King&mdash;England or Normandy," said De Aquila.  "I
care not which it is, but make thy choice here and now."
</P>

<P>
"'The King, then," said Fulke, "for I see he is better served than
Robert.  Shall I swear it?"
</P>

<P>
"'No need," said De Aquila, and he laid his hand on the parchments
which Gilbert had written.  "It shall be some part of my Gilbert's
penance to copy out the savoury tale of thy life, till we have made
ten, twenty, an hundred, maybe, copies.  How many cattle, think you,
would the Bishop of Tours give for that tale?  Or thy brother?  Or the
Monks of Blois?  Minstrels will turn it into songs which thy own Saxon
serfs shall sing behind their plough-stilts, and men-at-arms riding
through thy Norman towns.  From here to Rome, Fulke, men will make very
merry over that tale, and how Fulke told it, hanging in a well, like a
drowned puppy.  This shall be thy punishment, if ever I find thee
double-dealing with thy King any more.  Meantime, the parchments stay
here with thy son.  Him I will return to thee when thou hast made my
peace with the King.  The parchments never."
</P>

<P>
'Fulke hid his face and groaned.
</P>

<P>
"'Bones of the Saints!" said De Aquila, laughing.  "The pen cuts deep.
I could never have fetched that grunt out of thee with any sword."
</P>

<P>
"'But so long as I do not anger thee, my tale will be secret?" said
Fulke.
</P>

<P>
"'Just so long.  Does that comfort thee, Fulke?" said De Aquila.
</P>

<P>
"'What other comfort have ye left me?" he said, and of a sudden he wept
hopelessly like a child, dropping his face on his knees.'
</P>

<P>
'Poor Fulke,' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'I pitied him also,' said Sir Richard.
</P>

<P>
"'After the spur, corn," said De Aquila, and he threw Fulke three
wedges of gold that he had taken from our little chest by the bedplace.
</P>

<P>
"'If I had known this," said Fulke, catching his breath, "I would never
have lifted hand against Pevensey.  Only lack of this yellow stuff has
made me so unlucky in my dealings."
</P>

<P>
'It was dawn then, and they stirred in the Great Hall below.  We sent
down Fulke's mail to be scoured, and when he rode away at noon under
his own and the King's banner, very splendid and stately did he show.
He smoothed his long beard, and called his son to his stirrup and
kissed him.  De Aquila rode with him as far as the New Mill landward.
We thought the night had been all a dream.'
</P>

<P>
'But did he make it right with the King?' Dan asked. 'About your not
being traitors, I mean.'
</P>

<P>
Sir Richard smiled.  'The King sent no second summons to Pevensey, nor
did he ask why De Aquila had not obeyed the first.  Yes, that was
Fulke's work.  I know not how he did it, but it was well and swiftly
done.'
</P>

<P>
'Then you didn't do anything to his son?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'The boy?  Oh, he was an imp!  He turned the keep doors out of dortoirs
while we had him.  He sang foul songs, learned in the Barons'
camps&mdash;poor fool; he set the hounds fighting in Hall; he lit the rushes
to drive out, as he said, the fleas; he drew his dagger on jehan, who
threw him down the stairway for it; and he rode his horse through crops
and among sheep.  But when we had beaten him, and showed him wolf and
deer, he followed us old men like a young, eager hound, and called us
"uncle".  His father came the summer's end to take him away, but the
boy had no lust to go, because of the otter-hunting, and he stayed on
till the fox-hunting.  I gave him a bittern's claw to bring him good
luck at shooting.  An imp, if ever there was!'
</P>

<P>
'And what happened to Gilbert?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Not even a whipping.  De Aquila said he would sooner a clerk, however
false, that knew the Manor-roll than a fool, however true, that must be
taught his work afresh. Moreover, after that night I think Gilbert
loved as much as he feared De Aquila.  At least he would not leave
us&mdash;not even when Vivian, the King's Clerk, would have made him
Sacristan of Battle Abbey.  A false fellow, but, in his fashion, bold.'
</P>

<P>
'Did Robert ever land in Pevensey after all?' Dan went on.
</P>

<P>
'We guarded the coast too well while Henry was fighting his Barons; and
three or four years later, when England had peace, Henry crossed to
Normandy and showed his brother some work at Tenchebrai that cured
Robert of fighting.  Many of Henry's men sailed from Pevensey to that
war.  Fulke came, I remember, and we all four lay in the little chamber
once again, and drank together.  De Aquila was right.  One should not
judge men.  Fulke was merry.  Yes, always merry&mdash;with a catch in his
breath.'
</P>

<P>
'And what did you do afterwards?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'We talked together of times past.  That is all men can do when they
grow old, little maid.'
</P>

<BR>

<P>
The bell for tea rang faintly across the meadows.  Dan lay in the bows
of the Golden Hind; Una in the stern, the book of verses open in her
lap, was reading from 'The Slave's Dream':
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'Again, in the mist and shadow of sleep,<BR>
     He saw his native land.'<BR>
</P>

<P>
'I don't know when you began that,' said Dan, sleepily.
</P>

<P>
On the middle thwart of the boat, beside Una's sun-bonnet, lay an Oak
leaf, an Ash leaf, and a Thorn leaf, that must have dropped down from
the trees above; and the brook giggled as though it had just seen some
joke.

<P>
Dan had come to grief over his Latin, and was kept in; so Una went
alone to Far Wood.  Dan's big catapult and the lead bullets that Hobden
had made for him were hidden in an old hollow beech-stub on the west of
the wood. They had named the place out of the verse in Lays of Ancient
Rome:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     From lordly Volaterrae,<BR>
     Where scowls the far-famed hold<BR>
     Piled by the hands of giants<BR>
     For Godlike Kings of old.<BR>
</P>

<P>
They were the 'Godlike Kings', and when old Hobden piled some
comfortable brushwood between the big wooden knees of Volaterrae, they
called him 'Hands of Giants'.
</P>

<P>
Una slipped through their private gap in the fence, and sat still
awhile, scowling as scowlily and lordlily as she knew how; for
Volaterrae is an important watch-tower that juts out of Far Wood just
as Far Wood juts out of the hillside.  Pook's Hill lay below her and
all the turns of the brook as it wanders out of the Willingford Woods,
between hop-gardens, to old Hobden's cottage at the Forge.  The
sou'-west wind (there is always a wind by Volaterrae) blew from the
bare ridge where Cherry Clack Windmill stands.
</P>

<P>
Now wind prowling through woods sounds like exciting things going to
happen, and that is why on blowy days you stand up in Volaterrae and
shout bits of the Lays to suit its noises.
</P>

<P>
Una took Dan's catapult from its secret place, and made ready to meet
Lars Porsena's army stealing through the wind-whitened aspens by the
brook.  A gust boomed up the valley, and Una chanted sorrowfully:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'Verbenna down to Ostia<BR>
     Hath wasted all the plain:<BR>
     Astur hath stormed Janiculum,<BR>
     And the stout guards are slain.'<BR>
</P>

<P>
But the wind, not charging fair to the wood, started aside and shook a
single oak in Gleason's pasture.  Here it made itself all small and
crouched among the grasses, waving the tips of them as a cat waves the
tip of her tail before she springs.
</P>

<P>
'Now welcome&mdash;welcome, Sextus,' sang Una, loading the catapult&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     'Now welcome to thy home!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Why dost thou stay, and turn away?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Here lies the road to Rome.'<BR>
</P>

<P>
She fired into the face of the lull, to wake up the cowardly wind, and
heard a grunt from behind a thorn in the pasture.
</P>

<P>
'Oh, my Winkie!' she said aloud, and that was something she had picked
up from Dan.  'I b'lieve I've tickled up a Gleason cow.'
</P>

<P>
'You little painted beast!' a voice cried.  'I'll teach you to sling
your masters!'
</P>

<P>
She looked down most cautiously, and saw a young man covered with hoopy
bronze armour all glowing among the late broom.  But what Una admired
beyond all was his great bronze helmet with a red horse-tail that
flicked in the wind.  She could hear the long hairs rasp on his
shimmery shoulder-plates.
</P>

<P>
'What does the Faun mean,' he said, half aloud to himself, 'by telling
me that the Painted People have changed?'  He caught sight of Una's
yellow head.  'Have you seen a painted lead-slinger?' he called.
</P>

<P>
'No-o,' said Una.  'But if you've seen a bullet&mdash;'
</P>

<P>
'Seen?' cried the man.  'It passed within a hair's&mdash;breadth of my ear.'
</P>

<P>
'Well, that was me.  I'm most awfully sorry.'
</P>

<P>
'Didn't the Faun tell you I was coming?'  He smiled.
</P>

<P>
'Not if you mean Puck.  I thought you were a Gleason cow.  I&mdash;I didn't
know you were a&mdash;a&mdash;What are you?'
</P>

<P>
He laughed outright, showing a set of splendid teeth. His face and eyes
were dark, and his eyebrows met above his big nose in one bushy black
bar.
</P>

<P>
'They call me Parnesius.  I have been a Centurion of the Seventh Cohort
of the Thirtieth Legion&mdash;the Ulpia Victrix. Did you sling that bullet?'
</P>

<P>
'I did.  I was using Dan's catapult,' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Catapults!' said he.  'I ought to know something about them.  Show me!'
</P>

<P>
He leaped the rough fence with a rattle of spear, shield, and armour,
and hoisted himself into Volaterrae as quickly as a shadow.
</P>

<P>
'A sling on a forked stick.  I understand!' he cried, and pulled at the
elastic.  'But what wonderful beast yields this stretching leather?'
</P>

<P>
'It's laccy&mdash;elastic.  You put the bullet into that loop, and then you
pull hard.'
</P>

<P>
The man pulled, and hit himself square on his thumbnail.
</P>

<P>
'Each to his own weapon,' he said gravely, handing it back.  'I am
better with the bigger machine, little maiden. But it's a pretty toy.
A wolf would laugh at it.  Aren't you afraid of wolves?'
</P>

<P>
'There aren't any,' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Never believe it!  A wolf's like a Winged Hat.  He comes when he isn't
expected.  Don't they hunt wolves here?'
</P>

<P>
'We don't hunt,'said Una, remembering what she had heard from
grown-ups.  'We preserve&mdash;pheasants.  Do you know them?'
</P>

<P>
'I ought to,' said the young man, smiling again, and he imitated the
cry of the cock-pheasant so perfectly that a bird answered out of the
wood.
</P>

<P>
'What a big painted clucking fool is a pheasant!' he said.  'Just like
some Romans.'
</P>

<P>
'But you're a Roman yourself, aren't you?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Ye-es and no.  I'm one of a good few thousands who have never seen
Rome except in a picture.  My people have lived at Vectis for
generations.  Vectis&mdash;that island West yonder that you can see from so
far in clear weather.'
</P>

<P>
'Do you mean the Isle of Wight?  It lifts up just before rain, and you
see it from the Downs.'
</P>

<P>
'Very likely.  Our villa's on the south edge of the Island, by the
Broken Cliffs.  Most of it is three hundred years old, but the
cow-stables, where our first ancestor lived, must be a hundred years
older.  Oh, quite that, because the founder of our family had his land
given him by Agricola at the Settlement.  It's not a bad little place
for its size.  In springtime violets grow down to the very beach. I've
gathered sea-weeds for myself and violets for my Mother many a time
with our old nurse.'
</P>

<P>
'Was your nurse a&mdash;a Romaness too?'
</P>

<P>
'No, a Numidian.  Gods be good to her!  A dear, fat, brown thing with a
tongue like a cowbell.  She was a free woman.  By the way, are you
free, maiden?'
</P>

<P>
'Oh, quite,' said Una.  'At least, till tea-time; and in summer our
governess doesn't say much if we're late.'
</P>

<P>
The young man laughed again&mdash;a proper understanding laugh.
</P>

<P>
'I see,' said he.  'That accounts for your being in the wood.  We hid
among the cliffs.'
</P>

<P>
'Did you have a governess, then?'
</P>

<P>
'Did we not?  A Greek, too.  She had a way of clutching her dress when
she hunted us among the gorse-bushes that made us laugh.  Then she'd
say she'd get us whipped.  She never did, though, bless her!  Aglaia
was a thorough sportswoman, for all her learning.'
</P>

<P>
'But what lessons did you do&mdash;when&mdash;when you were little?' 'Ancient
history, the Classics, arithmetic and so on,'he answered.  'My sister
and I were thickheads, but my two brothers (I'm the middle one) liked
those things, and, of course, Mother was clever enough for any six.
She was nearly as tall as I am, and she looked like the new statue on
the Western Road&mdash;the Demeter of the Baskets, you know.  And funny!
Roma Dea!  How Mother could make us laugh!'
</P>

<P>
'What at?'
</P>

<P>
'Little jokes and sayings that every family has.  Don't you know?'
</P>

<P>
'I know we have, but I didn't know other people had them too,' said
Una.  'Tell me about all your family, please.'
</P>

<P>
'Good families are very much alike.  Mother would sit spinning of
evenings while Aglaia read in her corner, and Father did accounts, and
we four romped about the passages.  When our noise grew too loud the
Pater would say, "Less tumult!  Less tumult!  Have you never heard of a
Father's right over his children?  He can slay them, my loves&mdash;slay
them dead, and the Gods highly approve of the action!" Then Mother
would prim up her dear mouth over the wheel and answer:  "H'm!  I'm
afraid there can't be much of the Roman Father about you!" Then the
Pater would roll up his accounts, and say, "I'll show you!" and
then&mdash;then, he'd be worse than any of us!'
</P>

<P>
'Fathers can&mdash;if they like,' said Una, her eyes dancing.
</P>

<P>
'Didn't I say all good families are very much the same?'
</P>

<P>
'What did you do in summer?' said Una.  'Play about, like us?'
</P>

<P>
'Yes, and we visited our friends.  There are no wolves in Vectis.  We
had many friends, and as many ponies as we wished.'
</P>

<P>
'It must have been lovely,' said Una.  'I hope it lasted for ever.'
</P>

<P>
'Not quite, little maid.  When I was about sixteen or seventeen, the
Father felt gouty, and we all went to the Waters.'
</P>

<P>
'What waters?'
</P>

<P>
'At Aquae Sulis.  Every one goes there.  You ought to get your Father
to take you some day.'
</P>

<P>
'But where?  I don't know,' said Una.
</P>

<P>
The young man looked astonished for a moment. 'Aquae Sulis,' he
repeated.  'The best baths in Britain.  Just as good, I'm told, as
Rome.  All the old gluttons sit in hot water, and talk scandal and
politics.  And the Generals come through the streets with their guards
behind them; and the magistrates come in their chairs with their stiff
guards behind them; and you meet fortune-tellers, and goldsmiths, and
merchants, and philosophers, and feather-sellers, and ultra-Roman
Britons, and ultra-British Romans, and tame tribesmen pretending to be
civilised, and Jew lecturers, and&mdash;oh, everybody interesting. We young
people, of course, took no interest in politics.  We had not the gout.
There were many of our age like us.  We did not find life sad.
</P>

<P>
'But while we were enjoying ourselves without thinking, my sister met
the son of a magistrate in the West&mdash;and a year afterwards she was
married to him.  My young brother, who was always interested in plants
and roots, met the First Doctor of a Legion from the City of the
Legions, and he decided that he would be an Army doctor.  I do not
think it is a profession for a well-born man, but then&mdash;I'm not my
brother.  He went to Rome to study medicine, and now he's First Doctor
of a Legion in Egypt&mdash;at Antinoe, I think, but I have not heard from
him for some time.
</P>

<P>
'My eldest brother came across a Greek philosopher, and told my Father
that he intended to settle down on the estate as a farmer and a
philosopher.  You see,'&mdash;the young man's eyes twinkled&mdash;'his
philosopher was a long-haired one!'
</P>

<P>
'I thought philosophers were bald,' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Not all.  She was very pretty.  I don't blame him. Nothing could have
suited me better than my eldest brother's doing this, for I was only
too keen to join the Army.  I had always feared I should have to stay
at home and look after the estate while my brother took this.'
</P>

<P>
He rapped on his great glistening shield that never seemed to be in his
way.
</P>

<P>
'So we were well contented&mdash;we young people&mdash;and we rode back to
Clausentum along the Wood Road very quietly.  But when we reached home,
Aglaia, our governess, saw what had come to us.  I remember her at the
door, the torch over her head, watching us climb the cliff-path from
the boat.  "Aie!  Aie!" she said.  "Children you went away.  Men and a
woman you return!" Then she kissed Mother, and Mother wept.  Thus our
visit to the Waters settled our fates for each of us, maiden.' He rose
to his feet and listened, leaning on the shield-rim.
</P>

<P>
'I think that's Dan&mdash;my brother,' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Yes; and the Faun is with him,'he replied, as Dan with Puck stumbled
through the copse.
</P>

<P>
'We should have come sooner,' Puck called, 'but the beauties of your
native tongue, O Parnesius, have enthralled this young citizen.'
</P>

<P>
Parnesius looked bewildered, even when Una explained.
</P>

<P>
'Dan said the plural of "dominus" was "dominoes", and when Miss Blake
said it wasn't he said he supposed it was "backgammon", and so he had
to write it out twice&mdash;for cheek, you know.' Dan had climbed into
Volaterrae, hot and panting.
</P>

<P>
'I've run nearly all the way,'he gasped, 'and then Puck met me.  How do
you do, sir?'
</P>

<P>
'I am in good health,' Parnesius answered.  'See!  I have tried to bend
the bow of Ulysses, but&mdash;' He held up his thumb.
</P>

<P>
'I'm sorry.  You must have pulled off too soon,' said Dan.  'But Puck
said you were telling Una a story.'
</P>

<P>
'Continue, O Parnesius,' said Puck, who had perched himself on a dead
branch above them.  'I will be chorus. Has he puzzled you much, Una?'
'Not a bit, except&mdash;I didn't know where Ak&mdash;Ak something was,' she
answered.
</P>

<P>
'Oh, Aquae Sulis.  That's Bath, where the buns come from.  Let the hero
tell his own tale.'
</P>

<P>
Parnesius pretended to thrust his spear at Puck's legs, but Puck
reached down, caught at the horse-tail plume, and pulled off the tall
helmet.
</P>

<P>
'Thanks, jester,' said Parnesius, shaking his curly dark head.  'That
is cooler.  Now hang it up for me.
</P>

<P>
'I was telling your sister how I joined the Army,' he said to Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Did you have to pass an Exam?' Dan asked eagerly.
</P>

<P>
'No.  I went to my Father, and said I should like to enter the Dacian
Horse (I had seen some at Aquae Sulis); but he said I had better begin
service in a regular Legion from Rome.  Now, like many of our
youngsters, I was not too fond of anything Roman.  The Roman-born
officers and magistrates looked down on us British-born as though we
were barbarians.  I told my Father so.
</P>

<P>
"'I know they do," he said; "but remember, after all, we are the people
of the Old Stock, and our duty is to the Empire."
</P>

<P>
"'To which Empire?" I asked.  "We split the Eagle before I was born."
</P>

<P>
"'What thieves' talk is that?" said my Father.  He hated slang.
</P>

<P>
"'Well, sir," I said, "we've one Emperor in Rome, and I don't know how
many Emperors the outlying Provinces have set up from time to time.
Which am I to follow?"
</P>

<P>
"'Gratian," said he.  "At least he's a sportsman."
</P>

<P>
"'He's all that," I said.  "Hasn't he turned himself into a
raw-beef-eating Scythian?"
</P>

<P>
"'Where did you hear of it?" said the Pater.
</P>

<P>
"'At Aquae Sulis," I said.  It was perfectly true.  This precious
Emperor Gratian of ours had a bodyguard of fur-cloaked Scythians, and
he was so crazy about them that he dressed like them.  In Rome of all
places in the world!  It was as bad as if my own Father had painted
himself blue!
</P>

<P>
"'No matter for the clothes," said the Pater.  "They are only the
fringe of the trouble.  It began before your time or mine.  Rome has
forsaken her Gods, and must be punished.  The great war with the
Painted People broke out in the very year the temples of our Gods were
destroyed.  We beat the Painted People in the very year our temples
were rebuilt.  Go back further still." He went back to the time of
Diocletian; and to listen to him you would have thought Eternal Rome
herself was on the edge of destruction, just because a few people had
become a little large-minded.
</P>

<P>
'I knew nothing about it.  Aglaia never taught us the history of our
own country.  She was so full of her ancient Greeks.
</P>

<P>
"'There is no hope for Rome," said the Pater, at last. "She has
forsaken her Gods, but if the Gods forgive us here, we may save
Britain.  To do that, we must keep the Painted People back.  Therefore,
I tell you, Parnesius, as a Father, that if your heart is set on
service, your place is among men on the Wall&mdash;and not with women among
the cities."'
</P>

<P>
'What Wall?' asked Dan and Una at once.
</P>

<P>
'Father meant the one we call Hadrian's Wall.  I'll tell you about it
later.  It was built long ago, across North Britain, to keep out the
Painted People&mdash;Picts, you call them.  Father had fought in the great
Pict War that lasted more than twenty years, and he knew what fighting
meant.  Theodosius, one of our great Generals, had chased the little
beasts back far into the North before I was born.  Down at Vectis, of
course, we never troubled our heads about them.  But when my Father
spoke as he did, I kissed his hand, and waited for orders.  We
British-born Romans know what is due to our parents.'
</P>

<P>
'If I kissed my Father's hand, he'd laugh,' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Customs change; but if you do not obey your Father, the Gods remember
it.  You may be quite sure of that.
</P>

<P>
'After our talk, seeing I was in earnest, the Pater sent me over to
Clausentum to learn my foot-drill in a barrack full of foreign
Auxiliaries&mdash;as unwashed and unshaved a mob of mixed barbarians as ever
scrubbed a breastplate. It was your stick in their stomachs and your
shield in their faces to push them into any sort of formation.  When I
had learned my work the Instructor gave me a handful&mdash;and they were a
handful!&mdash;-of Gauls and Iberians to polish up till they were sent to
their stations up-country.  I did my best, and one night a villa in the
suburbs caught fire, and I had my handful out and at work before any of
the other troops.  I noticed a quiet-looking man on the lawn, leaning
on a stick.  He watched us passing buckets from the pond, and at last
he said to me:  "Who are you?"
</P>

<P>
"'A probationer, waiting for a command," I answered. I didn't know who
he was from Deucalion!
</P>

<P>
"'Born in Britain?" he said.
</P>

<P>
"'Yes, if you were born in Spain," I said, for he neighed his words
like an Iberian mule.
</P>

<P>
"'And what might you call yourself when you are at home?" he said,
laughing.
</P>

<P>
"'That depends," I answered; "sometimes one thing and sometimes
another.  But now I'm busy."
</P>

<P>
'He said no more till we had saved the family Gods (they were
respectable householders), and then he grunted across the laurels:
"Listen, young sometimes-one-thing-and-sometimes-another.  In future
call yourself Centurion of the Seventh Cohort of the Thirtieth, the
Ulpia Victrix.  That will help me to remember you.  Your Father and a
few other people call me Maximus."
</P>

<P>
'He tossed me the polished stick he was leaning on, and went away.  You
might have knocked me down with it!' 'Who was he?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Maximus himself, our great General!  The General of Britain who had
been Theodosius's right hand in the Pict War!  Not only had he given me
my Centurion's stick direct, but three steps in a good Legion as well!
A new man generally begins in the Tenth Cohort of his Legion, and works
up.'
</P>

<P>
'And were you pleased?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Very.  I thought Maximus had chosen me for my good looks and fine
style in marching, but, when I went home, the Pater told me he had
served under Maximus in the great Pict War, and had asked him to
befriend me.'
</P>

<P>
'A child you were!' said Puck, from above.
</P>

<P>
'I was,' said Parnesius.  'Don't begrudge it me, Faun. Afterwards&mdash;the
Gods know I put aside the games!'  And Puck nodded, brown chin on brown
hand, his big eyes still.
</P>

<P>
'The night before I left we sacrificed to our ancestors&mdash;the usual
little Home Sacrifice&mdash;but I never prayed so earnestly to all the Good
Shades, and then I went with my Father by boat to Regnum, and across
the chalk eastwards to Anderida yonder.'
</P>

<P>
'Regnum?  Anderida?'  The children turned their faces to Puck.
</P>

<P>
'Regnum's Chichester,' he said, pointing towards Cherry Clack,
'and'&mdash;he threw his arm South behind him&mdash;'Anderida's Pevensey.'
</P>

<P>
'Pevensey again!' said Dan.  'Where Weland landed?'
</P>

<P>
'Weland and a few others,' said Puck.  'Pevensey isn't young&mdash;even
compared to me!'
</P>

<P>
'The headquarters of the Thirtieth lay at Anderida in summer, but my
own Cohort, the Seventh, was on the Wall up North.  Maximus was
inspecting Auxiliaries&mdash;the Abulci, I think&mdash;at Anderida, and we stayed
with him, for he and my Father were very old friends.  I was only there
ten days when I was ordered to go up with thirty men to my Cohort.'  He
laughed merrily.  'A man never forgets his first march.  I was happier
than any Emperor when I led my handful through the North Gate of the
Camp, and we saluted the guard and the Altar of Victory there.'
</P>

<P>
'How?  How?' said Dan and Una.
</P>

<P>
Parnesius smiled, and stood up, flashing in his armour.
</P>

<P>
'So!' said he; and he moved slowly through the beautiful movements of
the Roman Salute, that ends with a hollow clang of the shield coming
into its place between the shoulders.
</P>

<P>
'Hai!' said Puck.  'That sets one thinking!'
</P>

<P>
'We went out fully armed,' said Parnesius, sitting down; 'but as soon
as the road entered the Great Forest, my men expected the pack-horses
to hang their shields on.  "No!" I said; "you can dress like women in
Anderida, but while you're with me you will carry your own weapons and
armour."
</P>

<P>
"'But it's hot," said one of them, "and we haven't a doctor.  Suppose
we get sunstroke, or a fever?"
</P>

<P>
"'Then die," I said, "and a good riddance to Rome!  Up shield&mdash;up
spears, and tighten your foot-wear!"
</P>

<P>
"'Don't think yourself Emperor of Britain already," a fellow shouted.
I knocked him over with the butt of my spear, and explained to these
Roman-born Romans that, if there were any further trouble, we should go
on with one man short.  And, by the Light of the Sun, I meant it too!
My raw Gauls at Clausentum had never treated me so.
</P>

<P>
'Then, quietly as a cloud, Maximus rode out of the fern (my Father
behind him), and reined up across the road.  He wore the Purple, as
though he were already Emperor; his leggings were of white buckskin
laced with gold.
</P>

<P>
'My men dropped like&mdash;like partridges.
</P>

<P>
'He said nothing for some time, only looked, with his eyes puckered.
Then he crooked his forefinger, and my men walked&mdash;crawled, I mean&mdash;to
one side.
</P>

<P>
"'Stand in the sun, children," he said, and they formed up on the hard
road.
</P>

<P>
"'What would you have done," he said to me, "if I had not been here?"
</P>

<P>
"'I should have killed that man," I answered.
</P>

<P>
"'Kill him now," he said.  "He will not move a limb."
</P>

<P>
"'No," I said.  "You've taken my men out of my command.  I should only
be your butcher if I killed him now." Do you see what I meant?'
Parnesius turned to Dan. 'Yes,'said Dan.  'It wouldn't have been fair,
somehow.'
</P>

<P>
'That was what I thought,' said Parnesius.  'But Maximus frowned.
"You'll never be an Emperor," he said.  "Not even a General will you
be."
</P>

<P>
'I was silent, but my Father seemed pleased. "'I came here to see the
last of you," he said.
</P>

<P>
"'You have seen it," said Maximus.  "I shall never need your son any
more.  He will live and he will die an officer of a Legion&mdash;and he
might have been Prefect of one of my Provinces.  Now eat and drink with
us," he said.  "Your men will wait till you have finished."
</P>

<P>
'My miserable thirty stood like wine-skins glistening in the hot sun,
and Maximus led us to where his people had set a meal.  Himself he
mixed the wine.
</P>

<P>
"'A year from now," he said, "you will remember that you have sat with
the Emperor of Britain&mdash;and Gaul."
</P>

<P>
"'Yes," said the Pater, "you can drive two mules&mdash;Gaul and Britain."
</P>

<P>
"'Five years hence you will remember that you have drunk"&mdash;he passed me
the cup and there was blue borage in it&mdash;"with the Emperor of Rome!"
</P>

<P>
"'No; you can't drive three mules.  They will tear YOU in pieces," said
my Father.
</P>

<P>
"'And you on the Wall, among the heather, will weep because your notion
of justice was more to you than the favour of the Emperor of Rome."
</P>

<P>
'I sat quite still.  One does not answer a General who wears the Purple.
</P>

<P>
"'I am not angry with you," he went on; "I owe too much to your
Father&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"'You owe me nothing but advice that you never took," said the Pater.
</P>

<P>
"'&mdash;to be unjust to any of your family.  Indeed, I say you may make a
good Tribune, but, so far as I am concerned, on the Wall you will live,
and on the Wall you will die," said Maximus.
</P>

<P>
"'Very like," said my Father.  "But we shall have the Picts and their
friends breaking through before long. You cannot move all troops out of
Britain to make you Emperor, and expect the North to sit quiet." "'I
follow my destiny," said Maximus.
</P>

<P>
"'Follow it, then," said my Father, pulling up a fern root; "and die as
Theodosius died."
</P>

<P>
"'Ah!" said Maximus.  "My old General was killed because he served the
Empire too well.  I may be killed, but not for that reason," and he
smiled a little pale grey smile that made my blood run cold.
</P>

<P>
"'Then I had better follow my destiny," I said, "and take my men to the
Wall."
</P>

<P>
'He looked at me a long time, and bowed his head slanting like a
Spaniard.  "Follow it, boy," he said.  That was all.  I was only too
glad to get away, though I had many messages for home.  I found my men
standing as they had been put&mdash;they had not even shifted their feet in
the dust, and off I marched, still feeling that terrific smile like an
east wind up my back.  I never halted them till sunset, and'&mdash;he turned
about and looked at Pook's Hill below him&mdash;'then I halted yonder.'  He
pointed to the broken, bracken-covered shoulder of the Forge Hill
behind old Hobden's cottage.
</P>

<P>
'There?  Why, that's only the old Forge&mdash;where they made iron once,'
said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Very good stuff it was too,' said Parnesius calmly.  'We mended three
shoulder-straps here and had a spear-head riveted.  The Forge was
rented from the Government by a one-eyed smith from Carthage.  I
remember we called him Cyclops.  He sold me a beaver-skin rug for my
sister's room.'
</P>

<P>
'But it couldn't have been here,' Dan insisted.
</P>

<P>
'But it was!  From the Altar of Victory at Anderida to the First Forge
in the Forest here is twelve miles seven hundred paces.  It is all in
the Road Book.  A man doesn't forget his first march.  I think I could
tell you every station between this and&mdash;!  He leaned forward, but his
eye was caught by the setting sun.
</P>

<P>
It had come down to the top of Cherry Clack Hill, and the light poured
in between the tree trunks so that you could see red and gold and black
deep into the heart of Far Wood; and Parnesius in his armour shone as
though he had been afire.
</P>

<P>
'Wait!' he said, lifting a hand, and the sunlight jinked on his glass
bracelet.  'Wait!  I pray to Mithras!'
</P>

<P>
He rose and stretched his arms westward, with deep, splendid-sounding
words. Then Puck began to sing too, in a voice like bells tolling, and
as he sang he slipped from Volaterrae to the ground, and beckoned the
children to follow.  They obeyed; it seemed as though the voices were
pushing them along; and through the goldy-brown light on the beech
leaves they walked, while Puck between them chanted something like this:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'Cur mundus militat sub vana gloria<BR>
     Cujus prosperitas est transitoria?<BR>
     Tam cito labitur ejus potentia<BR>

</P>

<P>
They found themselves at the little locked gates of the wood.
</P>

     'Quo Caesar abiit celsus imperio?<BR>
     Vel Dives splendidus totus in prandio?<BR>
     Dic ubi Tullius&mdash;'<BR>
</P>

<P>
Still singing, he took Dan's hand and wheeled him round to face Una as
she came out of the gate.  It shut behind her, at the same time as Puck
threw the memory-magicking Oak, Ash and Thorn leaves over their heads.
</P>

<P>
'Well, you are jolly late,' said Una.  'Couldn't you get away before?'
</P>

<P>
'I did,' said Dan.  'I got away in lots of time, but&mdash;but I didn't know
it was so late.  Where've you been?'
</P>

<P>
'In Volaterrae&mdash;waiting for you.'
</P>

<P>
'Sorry,' said Dan.  'It was all that beastly Latin.'

<P>
They were standing by the gate to Far Wood when they heard this song.
Without a word they hurried to their private gap and wriggled through
the hedge almost atop of a jay that was feeding from Puck's hand.
'Gently!' said Puck.  'What are you looking for?'
</P>

<P>
'Parnesius, of course,' Dan answered.  'We've only just remembered
yesterday.  It isn't fair.'
</P>

<P>
Puck chuckled as he rose.  'I'm sorry, but children who spend the
afternoon with me and a Roman Centurion need a little settling dose of
Magic before they go to tea with their governess.  Ohe, Parnesius!' he
called.
</P>

<P>
'Here, Faun!' came the answer from Volaterrae.  They could see the
shimmer of bronze armour in the beech-crotch, and the friendly flash of
the great shield uplifted.
</P>

<P>
'I have driven out the Britons.'  Parnesius laughed like a boy.  'I
occupy their high forts.  But Rome is merciful!  You may come up.'And
up they three all scrambled.
</P>

<P>
'What was the song you were singing just now?' said Una, as soon as she
had settled herself.
</P>

<P>
'That?  Oh, Rimini.  It's one of the tunes that are always being born
somewhere in the Empire.  They run like a pestilence for six months or
a year, till another one pleases the Legions, and then they march to
that.'
</P>

<P>
'Tell them about the marching, Parnesius.  Few people nowadays walk
from end to end of this country,' said Puck.
</P>

<P>
'The greater their loss.  I know nothing better than the Long March
when your feet are hardened.  You begin after the mists have risen, and
you end, perhaps, an hour after sundown.'
</P>

<P>
'And what do you have to eat?' Dan asked promptly.
</P>

<P>
'Fat bacon, beans, and bread, and whatever wine happens to be in the
rest-houses.  But soldiers are born grumblers.  Their very first day
out, my men complained of our water-ground British corn.  They said it
wasn't so filling as the rough stuff that is ground in the Roman
ox-mills.  However, they had to fetch and eat it.'
</P>

<P>
'Fetch it?  Where from?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'From that newly invented water-mill below the Forge.'
</P>

<P>
'That's Forge Mill&mdash;our Mill!'  Una looked at Puck.
</P>

<P>
'Yes; yours,' Puck put in.  'How old did you think it was?'
</P>

<P>
'I don't know.  Didn't Sir Richard Dalyngridge talk about it?'
</P>

<P>
'He did, and it was old in his day,' Puck answered. 'Hundreds of years
old.'
</P>

<P>
'It was new in mine,' said Parnesius.  'My men looked at the flour in
their helmets as though it had been a nest of adders.  They did it to
try my patience.  But I&mdash;addressed them, and we became friends.  To
tell the truth, they taught me the Roman Step.  You see, I'd only
served with quick-marching Auxiliaries.  A Legion's pace is altogether
different.  It is a long, slow stride, that never varies from sunrise
to sunset.  "Rome's Race&mdash;Rome's Pace," as the proverb says.
Twenty-four miles in eight hours, neither more nor less.  Head and
spear up, shield on your back, cuirass-collar open one
handsbreadth&mdash;and that's how you take the Eagles through Britain.'
</P>

<P>
'And did you meet any adventures?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'There are no adventures South the Wall,' said Parnesius.  'The worst
thing that happened me was having to appear before a magistrate up
North, where a wandering philosopher had jeered at the Eagles.  I was
able to show that the old man had deliberately blocked our road; and
the magistrate told him, out of his own Book, I believe, that, whatever
his Gods might be, he should pay proper respect to Caesar.'
</P>

<P>
'What did you do?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Went on.  Why should I care for such things, my business being to
reach my station?  It took me twenty days.
</P>

<P>
'Of course, the farther North you go the emptier are the roads.  At
last you fetch clear of the forests and climb bare hills, where wolves
howl in the ruins of our cities that have been.  No more pretty girls;
no more jolly magistrates who knew your Father when he was young, and
invite you to stay with them; no news at the temples and way-stations
except bad news of wild beasts.  There's where you meet hunters, and
trappers for the Circuses, prodding along chained bears and muzzled
wolves.  Your pony shies at them, and your men laugh.
</P>

<P>
'The houses change from gardened villas to shut forts with watch-towers
of grey stone, and great stone-walled sheepfolds, guarded by armed
Britons of the North Shore.  In the naked hills beyond the naked
houses, where the shadows of the clouds play like cavalry charging, you
see puffs of black smoke from the mines.  The hard road goes on and
on&mdash;and the wind sings through your helmet-plume&mdash;past altars to
Legions and Generals forgotten, and broken statues of Gods and Heroes,
and thousands of graves where the mountain foxes and hares peep at you.
Red-hot in summer, freezing in winter, is that big, purple heather
country of broken stone.
</P>

<P>
'Just when you think you are at the world's end, you see a smoke from
East to West as far as the eye can turn, and then, under it, also as
far as the eye can stretch, houses and temples, shops and theatres,
barracks and granaries, trickling along like dice behind&mdash;always
behind&mdash;one long, low, rising and falling, and hiding and showing line
of towers.  And that is the Wall!'
</P>

<P>
'Ah!' said the children, taking breath.
</P>

<P>
'You may well,' said Parnesius.  'Old men who have followed the Eagles
since boyhood say nothing in the Empire is more wonderful than first
sight of the Wall!'
</P>

<P>
'Is it just a Wall?  Like the one round the kitchen-garden?' said Dan.
'No, no!  It is the Wall.  Along the top are towers with guard-houses,
small towers, between.  Even on the narrowest part of it three men with
shields can walk abreast, from guard-house to guard-house.  A little
curtain wall, no higher than a man's neck, runs along the top of the
thick wall, so that from a distance you see the helmets of the sentries
sliding back and forth like beads.  Thirty feet high is the Wall, and
on the Picts' side, the North, is a ditch, strewn with blades of old
swords and spear-heads set in wood, and tyres of wheels joined by
chains.  The Little People come there to steal iron for their
arrow-heads.
</P>

<P>
'But the Wall itself is not more wonderful than the town behind it.
Long ago there were great ramparts and ditches on the South side, and
no one was allowed to build there.  Now the ramparts are partly pulled
down and built over, from end to end of the Wall; making a thin town
eighty miles long.  Think of it!  One roaring, rioting, cock-fighting,
wolf-baiting, horse-racing town, from Ituna on the West to Segedunum on
the cold eastern beach!  On one side heather, woods and ruins where
Picts hide, and on the other, a vast town&mdash;long like a snake, and
wicked like a snake.  Yes, a snake basking beside a warm wall!
</P>

<P>
'My Cohort, I was told, lay at Hunno, where the Great North Road runs
through the Wall into the Province of Valentia.'Parnesius laughed
scornfully.  'The Province of Valentia!  We followed the road,
therefore, into Hunno town, and stood astonished.  The place was a
fair&mdash;a fair of peoples from every corner of the Empire.  Some were
racing horses:  some sat in wine-shops:  some watched dogs baiting
bears, and many gathered in a ditch to see cocks fight.  A boy not much
older than myself, but I could see he was an officer, reined up before
me and asked what I wanted.
</P>

<P>
"'My station," I said, and showed him my shield.' Parnesius held up his
broad shield with its three X's like letters on a beer-cask.
</P>

<P>
"'Lucky omen!" said he.  "Your Cohort's the next tower to us, but
they're all at the cock-fight.  This is a happy place.  Come and wet
the Eagles." He meant to offer me a drink.
</P>

<P>
"'When I've handed over my men," I said.  I felt angry and ashamed.
</P>

<P>
"'Oh, you'll soon outgrow that sort of nonsense," he answered.  "But
don't let me interfere with your hopes. Go on to the Statue of Roma
Dea.  You can't miss it.  The main road into Valentia!" and he laughed
and rode off.  I could see the statue not a quarter of a mile away, and
there I went.  At some time or other the Great North Road ran under it
into Valentia; but the far end had been blocked up because of the
Picts, and on the plaster a man had scratched, "Finish!" It was like
marching into a cave. We grounded spears together, my little thirty,
and it echoed in the barrel of the arch, but none came.  There was a
door at one side painted with our number.  We prowled in, and I found a
cook asleep, and ordered him to give us food.  Then I climbed to the
top of the Wall, and looked out over the Pict country, and I&mdash;thought,'
said Parnesius.  'The bricked-up arch with "Finish!" on the plaster was
what shook me, for I was not much more than a boy.'
</P>

<P>
'What a shame!'said Una.  'But did you feel happy after you'd had a
good&mdash;'Dan stopped her with a nudge.
</P>

<P>
'Happy?' said Parnesius.  'When the men of the Cohort I was to command
came back unhelmeted from the cock-fight, their birds under their arms,
and asked me who I was?  No, I was not happy; but I made my new Cohort
unhappy too...  I wrote my Mother I was happy, but, oh, my friends'&mdash;he
stretched arms over bare knees&mdash;'I would not wish my worst enemy to
suffer as I suffered through my first months on the Wall.  Remember
this: among the officers was scarcely one, except myself (and I thought
I had lost the favour of Maximus, my General), scarcely one who had not
done something of wrong or folly.  Either he had killed a man, or taken
money, or insulted the magistrates, or blasphemed the Gods, and so had
been sent to the Wall as a hiding-place from shame or fear.  And the
men were as the officers.  Remember, also, that the Wall was manned by
every breed and race in the Empire.  No two towers spoke the same
tongue, or worshipped the same Gods.  In one thing only we were all
equal.  No matter what arms we had used before we came to the Wall, on
the Wall we were all archers, like the Scythians.  The Pict cannot run
away from the arrow, or crawl under it.  He is a bowman himself.  He
knows!'
</P>

<P>
'I suppose you were fighting Picts all the time,' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Picts seldom fight.  I never saw a fighting Pict for half a year.  The
tame Picts told us they had all gone North.'
</P>

<P>
'What is a tame Pict?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'A Pict&mdash;there were many such&mdash;who speaks a few words of our tongue,
and slips across the Wall to sell ponies and wolf-hounds.  Without a
horse and a dog, and a friend, man would perish.  The Gods gave me all
three, and there is no gift like friendship.  Remember this'&mdash;Parnesius
turned to Dan&mdash;'when you become a young man.  For your fate will turn
on the first true friend you make.'
</P>

<P>
'He means,' said Puck, grinning, 'that if you try to make yourself a
decent chap when you're young, you'll make rather decent friends when
you grow up.  If you're a beast, you'll have beastly friends.  Listen
to the Pious Parnesius on Friendship!'
</P>

<P>
'I am not pious,'Parnesius answered, 'but I know what goodness means;
and my friend, though he was without hope, was ten thousand times
better than I.  Stop laughing, Faun!'
</P>

<P>
'Oh, Youth Eternal and All-believing,' cried Puck, as he rocked on the
branch above.  'Tell them about your Pertinax.'
</P>

<P>
'He was that friend the Gods sent me&mdash;the boy who spoke to me when I
first came.  Little older than myself, commanding the Augusta Victoria
Cohort on the tower next to us and the Numidians.  In virtue he was far
my superior.'
</P>

<P>
'Then why was he on the Wall?' Una asked, quickly. 'They'd all done
something bad.  You said so yourself.'
</P>

<P>
'He was the nephew, his father had died, of a great rich man in Gaul
who was not always kind to his mother. When Pertinax grew up, he
discovered this, and so his uncle shipped him off, by trickery and
force, to the Wall. We came to know each other at a ceremony in our
Temple in the dark.  It was the Bull-Killing,'Parnesius explained to
Puck.
</P>

<P>
'I see, said Puck, and turned to the children.  'That's something you
wouldn't quite understand.  Parnesius means he met Pertinax in church.'
</P>

<P>
'Yes&mdash;in the Cave we first met, and we were both raised to the Degree
of Gryphons together.'  Parnesius lifted his hand towards his neck for
an instant.  'He had been on the Wall two years, and knew the Picts
well.  He taught me first how to take Heather.'
</P>

<P>
'What's that?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Going out hunting in the Pict country with a tame Pict. You are quite
safe so long as you are his guest, and wear a sprig of heather where it
can be seen.  If you went alone you would surely be killed, if you were
not smothered first in the bogs.  Only the Picts know their way about
those black and hidden bogs.  Old Allo, the one-eyed, withered little
Pict from whom we bought our ponies, was our special friend.  At first
we went only to escape from the terrible town, and to talk together
about our homes.  Then he showed us how to hunt wolves and those great
red deer with horns like Jewish candlesticks. The Roman-born officers
rather looked down on us for doing this, but we preferred the heather
to their amusements. Believe me,' Parnesius turned again to Dan, 'a boy
is safe from all things that really harm when he is astride a pony or
after a deer.  Do you remember, O Faun,'&mdash;he turned to Puck&mdash;'the
little altar I built to the Sylvan Pan by the pine-forest beyond the
brook?'
</P>

<P>
'Which?  The stone one with the line from Xenophon?' said Puck, in
quite a new voice.
</P>

<P>
'No!  What do I know of Xenophon?  That was Pertinax&mdash;after he had shot
his first mountain-hare with an arrow&mdash;by chance!  Mine I made of round
pebbles, in memory of my first bear.  It took me one happy day to
build.' Parnesius faced the children quickly.
</P>

<P>
'And that was how we lived on the Wall for two years&mdash;a little
scuffling with the Picts, and a great deal of hunting with old Allo in
the Pict country.  He called us his children sometimes, and we were
fond of him and his barbarians, though we never let them paint us
Pict-fashion.  The marks endure till you die.'
</P>

<P>
'How's it done?' said Dan.  'Anything like tattooing?'
</P>

<P>
'They prick the skin till the blood runs, and rub in coloured juices.
Allo was painted blue, green, and red from his forehead to his ankles.
He said it was part of his religion.  He told us about his religion
(Pertinax was always interested in such things), and as we came to know
him well, he told us what was happening in Britain behind the Wall.
Many things took place behind us in those days.  And by the Light of
the Sun,' said Parnesius, earnestly, 'there was not much that those
little people did not know!  He told me when Maximus crossed over to
Gaul, after he had made himself Emperor of Britain, and what troops and
emigrants he had taken with him.  We did not get the news on the Wall
till fifteen days later.  He told me what troops Maximus was taking out
of Britain every month to help him to conquer Gaul; and I always found
the numbers were as he said.  Wonderful!  And I tell another strange
thing!'
</P>

<P>
He joined his hands across his knees, and leaned his head on the curve
of the shield behind him.
</P>

<P>
'Late in the summer, when the first frosts begin and the Picts kill
their bees, we three rode out after wolf with some new hounds.
Rutilianus, our General, had given us ten days' leave, and we had
pushed beyond the Second Wall&mdash;beyond the Province of Valentia&mdash;into
the higher hills, where there are not even any of old Rome's ruins. We
killed a she-wolf before noon, and while Allo was skinning her he
looked up and said to me, "When you are Captain of the Wall, my child,
you won't be able to do this any more!"
</P>

<P>
'I might as well have been made Prefect of Lower Gaul, so I laughed and
said, "Wait till I am Captain."
</P>

<P>
"'No, don't wait," said Allo.  "Take my advice and go home&mdash;both of
you."
</P>

<P>
"'We have no homes," said Pertinax.  "You know that as well as we do.
We're finished men&mdash;thumbs down against both of us.  Only men without
hope would risk their necks on your ponies."
</P>

<P>
The old man laughed one of those short Pict laughs&mdash;like a fox barking
on a frosty night.  "I'm fond of you two," he said. "Besides, I've
taught you what little you know about hunting.  Take my advice and go
home."
</P>

<P>
"'We can't," I said.  "I'm out of favour with my General, for one
thing; and for another, Pertinax has an uncle."
</P>

<P>
"'I don't know about his uncle," said Allo, "but the trouble with you,
Parnesius, is that your General thinks well of you."
</P>

<P>
"'Roma Dea!" said Pertinax, sitting up.  "What can you guess what
Maximus thinks, you old horse-coper?"
</P>

<P>
'Just then (you know how near the brutes creep when one is eating?) a
great dog-wolf jumped out behind us, and away our rested hounds tore
after him, with us at their tails.  He ran us far out of any country
we'd ever heard of, straight as an arrow till sunset, towards the
sunset.  We came at last to long capes stretching into winding waters,
and on a grey beach below us we saw ships drawn up.  Forty-seven we
counted&mdash;not Roman galleys but the raven-winged ships from the North
where Rome does not rule.  Men moved in the ships, and the sun flashed
on their helmets&mdash;winged helmets of the red-haired men from the North
where Rome does not rule.  We watched, and we counted, and we wondered,
for though we had heard rumours concerning these Winged Hats, as the
Picts called them, never before had we looked upon them.
</P>

<P>
"'Come away!  come away!" said Allo.  "My Heather won't protect you
here.  We shall all be killed!" His legs trembled like his voice.  Back
we went&mdash;back across the heather under the moon, till it was nearly
morning, and our poor beasts stumbled on some ruins.
</P>

<P>
'When we woke, very stiff and cold, Allo was mixing the meal and water.
One does not light fires in the Pict country except near a village.
The little men are always signalling to each other with smokes, and a
strange smoke brings them out buzzing like bees.  They can sting, too!
</P>

<P>
"'What we saw last night was a trading-station," said Allo.  "Nothing
but a trading-station."
</P>

<P>
"'I do not like lies on an empty stomach," said Pertinax.  "I suppose"
(he had eyes like an eagle's)&mdash;"I suppose that is a trading-station
also?"  He pointed to a smoke far off on a hill-top, ascending in what
we call the Picts' Call:&mdash;-Puff&mdash;double-puff:  double-puff&mdash;puff!  They
make it by raising and dropping a wet hide on a fire.
</P>

<P>
"'No," said Allo, pushing the platter back into the bag. "That is for
you and me.  Your fate is fixed.  Come."
</P>

<P>
'We came.  When one takes Heather, one must obey one's Pict&mdash;but that
wretched smoke was twenty miles distant, well over on the East coast,
and the day was as hot as a bath.
</P>

<P>
"'Whatever happens," said Allo, while our ponies grunted along, "I want
you to remember me." "'I shall not forget," said Pertinax.  "You have
cheated me out of my breakfast."
</P>

<P>
"What is a handful of crushed oats to a Roman?" he said.  Then he
laughed his laugh that was not a laugh.
</P>

<P>
"What would you do if you were a handful of oats being crushed between
the upper and lower stones of a mill?"
</P>

<P>
"'I'm Pertinax, not a riddle-guesser," said Pertinax.
</P>

<P>
"'You're a fool," said Allo.  "Your Gods and my Gods are threatened by
strange Gods, and all you can do is to laugh."
</P>

<P>
"'Threatened men live long," I said.
</P>

<P>
"'I pray the Gods that may be true," he said.  "But I ask you again not
to forget me."
</P>

<P>
'We climbed the last hot hill and looked out on the eastern sea, three
or four miles off.  There was a small sailing-galley of the North Gaul
pattern at anchor, her landing-plank down and her sail half up; and
below us, alone in a hollow, holding his pony, sat Maximus, Emperor of
Britain!  He was dressed like a hunter, and he leaned on his little
stick; but I knew that back as far as I could see it, and I told
Pertinax.
</P>

<P>
"'You're madder than Allo!" he said.  "It must be the sun!"
</P>

<P>
'Maximus never stirred till we stood before him.  Then he looked me up
and down, and said:  "Hungry again?  It seems to be my destiny to feed
you whenever we meet.  I have food here.  Allo shall cook it."
</P>

<P>
"'No," said Allo.  "A Prince in his own land does not wait on wandering
Emperors.  I feed my two children without asking your leave." He began
to blow up the ashes.
</P>

<P>
"'I was wrong," said Pertinax.  "We are all mad.  Speak up, O Madman
called Emperor!"
</P>

<P>
'Maximus smiled his terrible tight-lipped smile, but two years on the
Wall do not make a man afraid of mere looks.  So I was not afraid.
</P>

<P>
"'I meant you, Parnesius, to live and die a Centurion of the Wall,"
said Maximus.  "But it seems from these,"&mdash;he fumbled in his
breast&mdash;"you can think as well as draw." He pulled out a roll of
letters I had written to my people, full of drawings of Picts, and
bears, and men I had met on the Wall.  Mother and my sister always
liked my pictures.
</P>

<P>
'He handed me one that I had called "Maximus's Soldiers".  It showed a
row of fat wine-skins, and our old Doctor of the Hunno hospital
snuffing at them.  Each time that Maximus had taken troops out of
Britain to help him to conquer Gaul, he used to send the garrisons more
wine&mdash;to keep them quiet, I suppose.  On the Wall, we always called a
wine-skin a "Maximus".  Oh, yes; and I had drawn them in Imperial
helmets.
</P>

<P>
"'Not long since," he went on, "men's names were sent up to Caesar for
smaller jokes than this."
</P>

<P>
"'True, Caesar," said Pertinax; "but you forget that was before I, your
friend's friend, became such a good spear-thrower."
</P>

<P>
'He did not actually point his hunting-spear at Maximus, but balanced
it on his palm&mdash;so!
</P>

<P>
"'I was speaking of time past," said Maximus, never fluttering an
eyelid.  "Nowadays one is only too pleased to find boys who can think
for themselves, and their friends." He nodded at Pertinax.  "Your
Father lent me the letters, Parnesius, so you run no risk from me."
</P>

<P>
"'None whatever," said Pertinax, and rubbed the spear-point on his
sleeve.
</P>

<P>
"'I have been forced to reduce the garrisons in Britain, because I need
troops in Gaul.  Now I come to take troops from the Wall itself," said
he.
</P>

<P>
"'I wish you joy of us," said Pertinax.  "We're the last sweepings of
the Empire&mdash;the men without hope. Myself, I'd sooner trust condemned
criminals."
</P>

<P>
"'You think so?" he said, quite seriously.  "But it will only be till I
win Gaul.  One must always risk one's life, or one's soul, or one's
peace&mdash;or some little thing."
</P>

<P>
'Allo passed round the fire with the sizzling deer's meat.  He served
us two first.
</P>

<P>
"'Ah!" said Maximus, waiting his turn.  "I perceive you are in your own
country.  Well, you deserve it.  They tell me you have quite a
following among the Picts, Parnesius."
</P>

<P>
"'I have hunted with them," I said.  "Maybe I have a few friends among
the heather."
</P>

<P>
"'He is the only armoured man of you all who understands us," said
Allo, and he began a long speech about our virtues, and how we had
saved one of his grandchildren from a wolf the year before.'
</P>

<P>
'Had you?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Yes; but that was neither here nor there.  The little green man orated
like a&mdash;like Cicero.  He made us out to be magnificent fellows.
Maximus never took his eyes off our faces.
</P>

<P>
"'Enough," he said.  "I have heard Allo on you.  I wish to hear you on
the Picts."
</P>

<P>
'I told him as much as I knew, and Pertinax helped me out.  There is
never harm in a Pict if you but take the trouble to find out what he
wants.  Their real grievance against us came from our burning their
heather.  The whole garrison of the Wall moved out twice a year, and
solemnly burned the heather for ten miles North. Rutilianus, our
General, called it clearing the country. The Picts, of course,
scampered away, and all we did was to destroy their bee-bloom in the
summer, and ruin their sheep-food in the spring.
</P>

<P>
"'True, quite true," said Allo.  "How can we make our holy
heather-wine, if you burn our bee-pasture?"
</P>

<P>
'We talked long, Maximus asking keen questions that showed he knew much
and had thought more about the Picts.  He said presently to me:  "If I
gave you the old Province of Valentia to govern, could you keep the
Picts contented till I won Gaul?  Stand away, so that you do not see
Allo's face; and speak your own thoughts."
</P>

<P>
"'No," I said.  "You cannot remake that Province.  The Picts have been
free too long."
</P>

<P>
"'Leave them their village councils, and let them furnish their own
soldiers," he said.  "You, I am sure, would hold the reins very
lightly."
</P>

<P>
"Even then, no," I said.  "At least not now.  They have been too
oppressed by us to trust anything with a Roman name for years and
years."
</P>

<P>
'I heard old Allo behind me mutter:  "Good child!"
</P>

<P>
"'Then what do you recommend," said Maximus, "to keep the North quiet
till I win Gaul?"
</P>

<P>
"'Leave the Picts alone," I said.  "Stop the heather-burning at once,
and&mdash;they are improvident little animals&mdash;send them a shipload or two
of corn now and then."
</P>

<P>
"'Their own men must distribute it&mdash;not some cheating Greek
accountant," said Pertinax.
</P>

<P>
"'Yes, and allow them to come to our hospitals when they are sick," I
said.
</P>

<P>
"'Surely they would die first," said Maximus.
</P>

<P>
"'Not if Parnesius brought them in," said Allo.  "I could show you
twenty wolf-bitten, bear-clawed Picts within twenty miles of here.  But
Parnesius must stay with them in hospital, else they would go mad with
fear."
</P>

<P>
"'I see," said Maximus.  "Like everything else in the world, it is one
man's work.  You, I think, are that one man."
</P>

<P>
"'Pertinax and I are one," I said.
</P>

<P>
"'As you please, so long as you work.  Now, Allo, you know that I mean
your people no harm.  Leave us to talk together," said Maximus.
</P>

<P>
"'No need!" said Allo.  "I am the corn between the upper and lower
millstones.  I must know what the lower millstone means to do.  These
boys have spoken the truth as far as they know it.  I, a Prince, will
tell you the rest.  I am troubled about the Men of the North." He
squatted like a hare in the heather, and looked over his shoulder.
</P>

<P>
"'I also," said Maximus, "or I should not be here."
</P>

<P>
"'Listen," said Allo.  "Long and long ago the Winged Hats"&mdash;he meant
the Northmen&mdash;"came to our beaches and said, 'Rome falls!  Push her
down!'  We fought you. You sent men.  We were beaten.  After that we
said to the Winged Hats, 'You are liars!  Make our men alive that Rome
killed, and we will believe you.'  They went away ashamed.  Now they
come back bold, and they tell the old tale, which we begin to
believe&mdash;that Rome falls!"
</P>

<P>
"'Give me three years' peace on the Wall," cried Maximus, "and I will
show you and all the ravens how they lie!"
</P>

<P>
"'Ah, I wish it too!  I wish to save what is left of the corn from the
millstones.  But you shoot us Picts when we come to borrow a little
iron from the Iron Ditch; you burn our heather, which is all our crop;
you trouble us with your great catapults.  Then you hide behind the
Wall, and scorch us with Greek fire.  How can I keep my young men from
listening to the Winged Hats&mdash;in winter especially, when we are hungry?
My young men will say, 'Rome can neither fight nor rule.  She is taking
her men out of Britain.  The Winged Hats will help us to push down the
Wall.  Let us show them the secret roads across the bogs.' Do I want
that?  No!" He spat like an adder.  "I would keep the secrets of my
people though I were burned alive.  My two children here have spoken
truth.  Leave us Picts alone.  Comfort us, and cherish us, and feed us
from far off&mdash;with the hand behind the back.  Parnesius understands us.
Let him have rule on the Wall, and I will hold my young men quiet
for"&mdash;he ticked it off on his fingers&mdash;"one year easily:  the next year
not so easily:  the third year, perhaps!  See, I give you three years.
If then you do not show us that Rome is strong in men and terrible in
arms, the Winged Hats, I tell you, will sweep down the Wall from either
sea till they meet in the middle, and you will go.  I shall not grieve
over that, but well I know tribe never helps tribe except for one
price.  We Picts will go too.  The Winged Hats will grind us to this!"
He tossed a handful of dust in the air.
</P>

<P>
"'Oh, Roma Dea!" said Maximus, half aloud.  "It is always one man's
work&mdash;always and everywhere!"
</P>

<P>
"And one man's life," said Allo.  "You are Emperor, but not a God.  You
may die."
</P>

<P>
"'I have thought of that too," said he.  "Very good.  If this wind
holds, I shall be at the East end of the Wall by morning.  Tomorrow,
then, I shall see you two when I inspect, and I will make you Captains
of the Wall for this work."
</P>

<P>
"'One instant, Caesar," said Pertinax.  "All men have their price.  I
am not bought yet."
</P>

<P>
"'Do you also begin to bargain so early?" said Maximus.  "Well?"
</P>

<P>
"'Give me justice against my uncle Icenus, the Duumvir of Divio in
Gaul," he said.
</P>

<P>
"'Only a life?  I thought it would be money or an office. Certainly you
shall have him.  Write his name on these tablets&mdash;on the red side; the
other is for the living!" and Maximus held out his tablets.
</P>

<P>
"'He is of no use to me dead," said Pertinax.  "My mother is a widow.
I am far off.  I am not sure he pays her all her dowry."
</P>

<P>
"'No matter.  My arm is reasonably long.  We will look through your
uncle's accounts in due time.  Now, farewell till tomorrow, O Captains
of the Wall!"
</P>

<P>
'We saw him grow small across the heather as he walked to the galley.
There were Picts, scores, each side of him, hidden behind stones.  He
never looked left or right.  He sailed away southerly, full spread
before the evening breeze, and when we had watched him out to sea, we
were silent.  We understood that Earth bred few men like to this man.
</P>

<P>
'Presently Allo brought the ponies and held them for us to mount&mdash;a
thing he had never done before.
</P>

<P>
"'Wait awhile," said Pertinax, and he made a little altar of cut turf,
and strewed heather-bloom atop, and laid upon it a letter from a girl
in Gaul.
</P>

<P>
"'What do you do, O my friend?" I said.
</P>

<P>
"'I sacrifice to my dead youth," he answered, and, when the flames had
consumed the letter, he ground them out with his heel.  Then we rode
back to that Wall of which we were to be Captains.'
</P>

<P>
Parnesius stopped.  The children sat still, not even asking if that
were all the tale.  Puck beckoned, and pointed the way out of the wood.
'Sorry,' he whispered, 'but you must go now.'
</P>

<P>
'We haven't made him angry, have we?' said Una.  'He looks so far off,
and&mdash;and&mdash;thinky.'
</P>

<P>
'Bless your heart, no.  Wait till tomorrow.  It won't be long.
Remember, you've been playing Lays of Ancient Rome.'
</P>

<P>
And as soon as they had scrambled through their gap where Oak, Ash and
Thorn grew, that was all they remembered.

<P>
The next day happened to be what they called a Wild Afternoon.  Father
and Mother went out to pay calls; Miss Blake went for a ride on her
bicycle, and they were left all alone till eight o'clock.
</P>

<P>
When they had seen their dear parents and their dear preceptress
politely off the premises they got a cabbage-leaf full of raspberries
from the gardener, and a Wild Tea from Ellen.  They ate the raspberries
to prevent their squashing, and they meant to divide the cabbage-leaf
with Three Cows down at the Theatre, but they came across a dead
hedgehog which they simply had to bury, and the leaf was too useful to
waste.
</P>

<P>
Then they went on to the Forge and found old Hobden the hedger at home
with his son, the Bee Boy, who is not quite right in his head, but who
can pick up swarms of bees in his naked hands; and the Bee Boy told
them the rhyme about the slow-worm:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'If I had eyes as I could see,<BR>
     No mortal man would trouble me.'<BR>
</P>

<P>
They all had tea together by the hives, and Hobden said the loaf-cake
which Ellen had given them was almost as good as what his wife used to
make, and he showed them how to set a wire at the right height for
hares.  They knew about rabbits already.
</P>

<P>
Then they climbed up Long Ditch into the lower end of Far Wood.  This
is sadder and darker than the Volaterrae end because of an old marl-pit
full of black water, where weepy, hairy moss hangs round the stumps of
the willows and alders.  But the birds come to perch on the dead
branches, and Hobden says that the bitter willow-water is a sort of
medicine for sick animals.
</P>

<P>
They sat down on a felled oak-trunk in the shadows of the beech
undergrowth, and were looping the wires Hobden had given them, when
they saw Parnesius.
</P>

<P>
'How quietly you came!'said Una, moving up to make room.  'Where's
Puck?'
</P>

<P>
'The Faun and I have disputed whether it is better that I should tell
you all my tale, or leave it untold,' he replied.
</P>

<P>
'I only said that if he told it as it happened you wouldn't understand
it,' said Puck, jumping up like a squirrel from behind the log. 'I
don't understand all of it,' said Una, 'but I like hearing about the
little Picts.'
</P>

<P>
'What I can't understand,' said Dan, 'is how Maximus knew all about the
Picts when he was over in Gaul.'
</P>

<P>
'He who makes himself Emperor anywhere must know everything,
everywhere,' said Parnesius.  'We had this much from Maximus's mouth
after the Games.'
</P>

<P>
'Games?  What Games?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
Parnesius stretched his arm out stiffly, thumb pointed to the ground.
'Gladiators!  That sort of game,' he said. 'There were two days' Games
in his honour when he landed all unexpected at Segedunum on the East
end of the Wall.  Yes, the day after we had met him we held two days'
Games; but I think the greatest risk was run, not by the poor wretches
on the sand, but by Maximus.  In the old days the Legions kept silence
before their Emperor. So did not we!  You could hear the solid roar run
West along the Wall as his chair was carried rocking through the
crowds.  The garrison beat round him&mdash;clamouring, clowning, asking for
pay, for change of quarters, for anything that came into their wild
heads.  That chair was like a little boat among waves, dipping and
falling, but always rising again after one had shut the eyes.'
Parnesius shivered. 'Were they angry with him?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'No more angry than wolves in a cage when their trainer walks among
them.  If he had turned his back an instant, or for an instant had
ceased to hold their eyes, there would have been another Emperor made
on the Wall that hour.  Was it not so, Faun?'
</P>

<P>
'So it was.  So it always will be,' said Puck.
</P>

<P>
'Late in the evening his messenger came for us, and we followed to the
Temple of Victory, where he lodged with Rutilianus, the General of the
Wall.  I had hardly seen the General before, but he always gave me
leave when I wished to take Heather.  He was a great glutton, and kept
five Asian cooks, and he came of a family that believed in oracles.  We
could smell his good dinner when we entered, but the tables were empty.
He lay snorting on a couch.  Maximus sat apart among long rolls of
accounts. Then the doors were shut.
</P>

<P>
"'These are your men," said Maximus to the General, who propped his
eye-corners open with his gouty fingers, and stared at us like a fish.
</P>

<P>
"'I shall know them again, Caesar," said Rutilianus.
</P>

<P>
"Very good," said Maximus.  "Now hear!  You are not to move man or
shield on the Wall except as these boys shall tell you.  You will do
nothing, except eat, without their permission.  They are the head and
arms.  You are the belly!"
</P>

<P>
"'As Caesar pleases," the old man grunted.  "If my pay and profits are
not cut, you may make my Ancestors' Oracle my master.  Rome has been!
Rome has been!" Then he turned on his side to sleep.
</P>

<P>
"'He has it," said Maximus.  "We will get to what I need."
</P>

<P>
'He unrolled full copies of the number of men and supplies on the
Wall&mdash;down to the sick that very day in Hunno Hospital.  Oh, but I
groaned when his pen marked off detachment after detachment of our
best&mdash;of our least worthless men!  He took two towers of our Scythians,
two of our North British auxiliaries, two Numidian cohorts, the Dacians
all, and half the Belgians. It was like an eagle pecking a carcass.
</P>

<P>
"'And now, how many catapults have you?"  He turned up a new list, but
Pertinax laid his open hand there.
</P>

<P>
"'No, Caesar," said he.  "Do not tempt the Gods too far.  Take men, or
engines, but not both; else we refuse."' 'Engines?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'The catapults of the Wall&mdash;huge things forty feet high to the
head&mdash;firing nets of raw stone or forged bolts. Nothing can stand
against them.  He left us our catapults at last, but he took a Caesar's
half of our men without pity.  We were a shell when he rolled up the
lists!
</P>

<P>
"'Hail, Caesar!  We, about to die, salute you!" said Pertinax,
laughing.  "If any enemy even leans against the Wall now, it will
tumble."
</P>

<P>
"'Give me the three years Allo spoke of," he answered, "and you shall
have twenty thousand men of your own choosing up here.  But now it is a
gamble&mdash;a game played against the Gods, and the stakes are Britain,
Gaul, and perhaps Rome.  You play on my side?"
</P>

<P>
"'We will play, Caesar," I said, for I had never met a man like this
man.
</P>

<P>
"Good.  Tomorrow," said he, "I proclaim you Captains of the Wall before
the troops."
</P>

<P>
'So we went into the moonlight, where they were cleaning the ground
after the Games.  We saw great Roma Dea atop of the Wall, the frost on
her helmet, and her spear pointed towards the North Star.  We saw the
twinkle of night-fires all along the guard-towers, and the line of the
black catapults growing smaller and smaller in the distance.  All these
things we knew till we were weary; but that night they seemed very
strange to us, because the next day we knew we were to be their masters.
</P>

<P>
'The men took the news well; but when Maximus went away with half our
strength, and we had to spread ourselves into the emptied towers, and
the townspeople complained that trade would be ruined, and the autumn
gales blew&mdash;it was dark days for us two.  Here Pertinax was more than
my right hand.  Being born and bred among the great country houses in
Gaul, he knew the proper words to address to all&mdash;from Roman-born
Centurions to those dogs of the Third&mdash;the Libyans. And he spoke to
each as though that man were as high-minded as himself.  Now I saw so
strongly what things were needed to be done, that I forgot things are
only accomplished by means of men.  That was a mistake.
</P>

<P>
'I feared nothing from the Picts, at least for that year, but Allo
warned me that the Winged Hats would soon come in from the sea at each
end of the Wall to prove to the Picts how weak we were.  So I made
ready in haste, and none too soon.  I shifted our best men to the ends
of the Wall, and set up screened catapults by the beach.  The Winged
Hats would drive in before the snow-squalls&mdash;ten or twenty boats at a
time&mdash;on Segedunum or Ituna, according as the wind blew.
</P>

<P>
'Now a ship coming in to land men must furl her sail.  If you wait till
you see her men gather up the sail's foot, your catapults can jerk a
net of loose stones (bolts only cut through the cloth) into the bag of
it.  Then she turns over, and the sea makes everything clean again.  A
few men may come ashore, but very few...  It was not hard work, except
the waiting on the beach in blowing sand and snow.  And that was how we
dealt with the Winged Hats that winter.
</P>

<P>
'Early in the spring, when the East winds blow like skinning-knives,
they gathered again off Segedunum with many ships.  Allo told me they
would never rest till they had taken a tower in open fight.  Certainly
they fought in the open.  We dealt with them thoroughly through a long
day:  and when all was finished, one man dived clear of the wreckage of
his ship, and swam towards shore.  I waited, and a wave tumbled him at
my feet.
</P>

<P>
'As I stooped, I saw he wore such a medal as I wear.' Parnesius raised
his hand to his neck.  'Therefore, when he could speak, I addressed him
a certain Question which can only be answered in a certain manner.  He
answered with the necessary Word&mdash;the Word that belongs to the Degree
of Gryphons in the science of Mithras my God.  I put my shield over him
till he could stand up.  You see I am not short, but he was a head
taller than I.  He said:  "What now?"  I said:  "At your pleasure, my
brother, to stay or go."
</P>

<P>
'He looked out across the surf.  There remained one ship unhurt, beyond
range of our catapults.  I checked the catapults and he waved her in.
She came as a hound comes to a master.  When she was yet a hundred
paces from the beach, he flung back his hair, and swam out. They hauled
him in, and went away.  I knew that those who worship Mithras are many
and of all races, so I did not think much more upon the matter.
</P>

<P>
'A month later I saw Allo with his horses&mdash;by the Temple of Pan, O
Faun&mdash;and he gave me a great necklace of gold studded with coral.
</P>

<P>
'At first I thought it was a bribe from some tradesman in the
town&mdash;meant for old Rutilianus.  "Nay," said Allo. "This is a gift from
Amal, that Winged Hat whom you saved on the beach.  He says you are a
Man."
</P>

<P>
"'He is a Man, too.  Tell him I can wear his gift," I answered.
</P>

<P>
"'Oh, Amal is a young fool; but 'speaking as sensible men, your Emperor
is doing such great things in Gaul that the Winged Hats are anxious to
be his friends, or, better still, the friends of his servants.  They
think you and Pertinax could lead them to victories." Allo looked at me
like a one-eyed raven.
</P>

<P>
"'Allo," I said, "you are the corn between the two millstones.  Be
content if they grind evenly, and don't thrust your hand between them."
</P>

<P>
"'I?" said Allo.  "I hate Rome and the Winged Hats equally; but if the
Winged Hats thought that some day you and Pertinax might join them
against Maximus, they would leave you in peace while you considered.
Time is what we need&mdash;you and I and Maximus.  Let me carry a pleasant
message back to the Winged Hats&mdash;something for them to make a council
over.  We barbarians are all alike.  We sit up half the night to
discuss anything a Roman says.  Eh?"
</P>

<P>
"'We have no men.  We must fight with words," said Pertinax.  "Leave it
to Allo and me."
</P>

<P>
'So Allo carried word back to the Winged Hats that we would not fight
them if they did not fight us; and they (I think they were a little
tired of losing men in the sea) agreed to a sort of truce.  I believe
Allo, who being a horse-dealer loved lies, also told them we might some
day rise against Maximus as Maximus had risen against Rome.
</P>

<P>
'Indeed, they permitted the corn-ships which I sent to the Picts to
pass North that season without harm.  Therefore the Picts were well fed
that winter, and since they were in some sort my children, I was glad
of it.  We had only two thousand men on the Wall, and I wrote many
times to Maximus and begged&mdash;prayed&mdash;him to send me only one cohort of
my old North British troops.  He could not spare them.  He needed them
to win more victories in Gaul.
</P>

<P>
'Then came news that he had defeated and slain the Emperor Gratian, and
thinking he must now be secure, I wrote again for men.  He answered:
"You will learn that I have at last settled accounts with the pup
Gratian.  There was no need that he should have died, but he became
confused and lost his head, which is a bad thing to befall any Emperor.
Tell your Father I am content to drive two mules only; for unless my
old General's son thinks himself destined to destroy me, I shall rest
Emperor of Gaul and Britain, and then you, my two children, will
presently get all the men you need.  Just now I can spare none."'
</P>

<P>
'What did he mean by his General's son?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'He meant Theodosius Emperor of Rome, who was the son of Theodosius the
General under whom Maximus had fought in the old Pict War.  The two men
never loved each other, and when Gratian made the younger Theodosius
Emperor of the East (at least, so I've heard), Maximus carried on the
war to the second generation.  It was his fate, and it was his fall.
But Theodosius the Emperor is a good man.  As I know.'  Parnesius was
silent for a moment and then continued.
</P>

<P>
'I wrote back to Maximus that, though we had peace on the Wall, I
should be happier with a few more men and some new catapults.  He
answered:  "You must live a little longer under the shadow of my
victories, till I can see what young Theodosius intends.  He may
welcome me as a brother-Emperor, or he may be preparing an army.  In
either case I cannot spare men just now."
</P>

<P>
'But he was always saying that,' cried Una.
</P>

<P>
'It was true.  He did not make excuses; but thanks, as he said, to the
news of his victories, we had no trouble on the Wall for a long, long
time.  The Picts grew fat as their own sheep among the heather, and as
many of my men as lived were well exercised in their weapons.  Yes, the
Wall looked strong.  For myself, I knew how weak we were.  I knew that
if even a false rumour of any defeat to Maximus broke loose among the
Winged Hats, they might come down in earnest, and then&mdash;the Wall must
go!  For the Picts I never cared, but in those years I learned
something of the strength of the Winged Hats.  They increased their
strength every day, but I could not increase my men.  Maximus had
emptied Britain behind us, and I felt myself to be a man with a rotten
stick standing before a broken fence to turn bulls.
</P>

<P>
'Thus, my friends, we lived on the Wall, waiting&mdash;waiting&mdash;waiting for
the men that Maximus never sent.
</P>

<P>
'Presently he wrote that he was preparing an army against Theodosius.
He wrote&mdash;and Pertinax read it over my shoulder in our quarters:  "Tell
your Father that my destiny orders me to drive three mules or be torn
in pieces by them.  I hope within a year to finish with Theodosius, son
of Theodosius, once and for all.  Then you shall have Britain to rule,
and Pertinax, if he chooses, Gaul.  Today I wish strongly you were with
me to beat my Auxiliaries into shape.  Do not, I pray you, believe any
rumour of my sickness.  I have a little evil in my old body which I
shall cure by riding swiftly into Rome."
</P>

<P>
'Said Pertinax:  "It is finished with Maximus.  He writes as a man
without hope.  I, a man without hope, can see this.  What does he add
at the bottom of the roll?  'Tell Pertinax I have met his late Uncle,
the Duumvir of Divio, and that he accounted to me quite truthfully for
all his Mother's monies.  I have sent her with a fitting escort, for
she is the mother of a hero, to Nicaea, where the climate is warm.'
</P>

<P>
"'That is proof," said Pertinax.  "Nicaea is not far by sea from Rome.
A woman there could take ship and fly to Rome in time of war.  Yes,
Maximus foresees his death, and is fulfilling his promises one by one.
But I am glad my uncle met him."'
</P>

<P>
"'You think blackly today?" I asked.
</P>

<P>
"'I think truth.  The Gods weary of the play we have played against
them.  Theodosius will destroy Maximus. It is finished!"
</P>

<P>
"'Will you write him that?" I said.
</P>

<P>
"'See what I shall write," he answered, and he took pen and wrote a
letter cheerful as the light of day, tender as a woman's and full of
jests.  Even I, reading over his shoulder, took comfort from it till&mdash;I
saw his face!
</P>

<P>
"'And now," he said, sealing it, "we be two dead men, my brother.  Let
us go to the Temple." 'We prayed awhile to Mithras, where we had many
times prayed before.  After that, we lived day by day among evil
rumours till winter came again.
</P>

<P>
'It happened one morning that we rode to the East shore, and found on
the beach a fair-haired man, half frozen, bound to some broken planks.
Turning him over, we saw by his belt-buckle that he was a Goth of an
Eastern Legion.  Suddenly he opened his eyes and cried loudly, "He is
dead!  The letters were with me, but the Winged Hats sank the ship." So
saying, he died between our hands.
</P>

<P>
'We asked not who was dead.  We knew!  We raced before the driving snow
to Hunno, thinking perhaps Allo might be there.  We found him already
at our stables, and he saw by our faces what we had heard.
</P>

<P>
"'It was in a tent by the sea," he stammered.  "He was beheaded by
Theodosius.  He sent a letter to you, written while he waited to be
slain.  The Winged Hats met the ship and took it.  The news is running
through the heather like fire.  Blame me not!  I cannot hold back my
young men any more."
</P>

<P>
"'I would we could say as much for our men," said Pertinax, laughing.
"But, Gods be praised, they cannot run away."
</P>

<P>
"'What do you do?" said Allo.  "I bring an order&mdash;a message&mdash;from the
Winged Hats that you join them with your men, and march South to
plunder Britain."
</P>

<P>
"'It grieves me," said Pertinax, "but we are stationed here to stop
that thing."
</P>

<P>
"'If I carry back such an answer they will kill me," said Allo.  "I
always promised the Winged Hats that you would rise when Maximus fell.
I&mdash;I did not think he could fall."
</P>

<P>
"'Alas!  my poor barbarian," said Pertinax, still laughing.  "Well, you
have sold us too many good ponies to be thrown back to your friends.
We will make you a prisoner, although you are an ambassador."
</P>

<P>
"'Yes, that will be best," said Allo, holding out a halter.  We bound
him lightly, for he was an old man.
</P>

<P>
"'Presently the Winged Hats may come to look for you, and that will
give us more time.  See how the habit of playing for time sticks to a
man!" said Pertinax, as he tied the rope.
</P>

<P>
"'No," I said.  "Time may help.  If Maximus wrote us a letter while he
was a prisoner, Theodosius must have sent the ship that brought it.  If
he can send ships, he can send men."
</P>

<P>
"'How will that profit us?" said Pertinax.  "We serve Maximus, not
Theodosius.  Even if by some miracle of the Gods Theodosius down South
sent and saved the Wall, we could not expect more than the death
Maximus died."
</P>

<P>
"'It concerns us to defend the Wall, no matter what Emperor dies, or
makes die," I said.
</P>

<P>
"'That is worthy of your brother the philosopher," said Pertinax.
"Myself I am without hope, so I do not say solemn and stupid things!
Rouse the Wall!"
</P>

<P>
'We armed the Wall from end to end; we told the officers that there was
a rumour of Maximus's death which might bring down the Winged Hats, but
we were sure, even if it were true, that Theodosius, for the sake of
Britain, would send us help.  Therefore, we must stand fast...  My
friends, it is above all things strange to see how men bear ill news!
Often the strongest till then become the weakest, while the weakest, as
it were, reach up and steal strength from the Gods.  So it was with us.
Yet my Pertinax by his jests and his courtesy and his labours had put
heart and training into our poor numbers during the past years&mdash;more
than I should have thought possible.  Even our Libyan Cohort&mdash;the
Third&mdash;stood up in their padded cuirasses and did not whimper. 'In
three days came seven chiefs and elders of the Winged Hats.  Among them
was that tall young man, Amal, whom I had met on the beach, and he
smiled when he saw my necklace.  We made them welcome, for they were
ambassadors.  We showed them Allo, alive but bound.  They thought we
had killed him, and I saw it would not have vexed them if we had.  Allo
saw it too, and it vexed him.  Then in our quarters at Hunno we came to
council.
</P>

<P>
'They said that Rome was falling, and that we must join them.  They
offered me all South Britain to govern after they had taken a tribute
out of it.
</P>

<P>
'I answered, "Patience.  This Wall is not weighed off like plunder.
Give me proof that my General is dead."
</P>

<P>
"'Nay," said one elder, "prove to us that he lives"; and another said
cunningly, "What will you give us if we read you his last words?"
</P>

<P>
"'We are not merchants to bargain," cried Amal. "Moreover, I owe this
man my life.  He shall have his proof." He threw across to me a letter
(well I knew the seal) from Maximus.
</P>

<P>
"'We took this out of the ship we sank," he cried.  "I cannot read, but
I know one sign, at least, which makes me believe."  He showed me a
dark stain on the outer roll that my heavy heart perceived was the
valiant blood of Maximus.
</P>

<P>
"'Read!" said Amal.  "Read, and then let us hear whose servants you
are!"
</P>

<P>
'Said Pertinax, very softly, after he had looked through it:  "I will
read it all.  Listen, barbarians!" He read that which I have carried
next my heart ever since.'
</P>

<P>
Parnesius drew from his neck a folded and spotted piece of parchment,
and began in a hushed voice:
</P>

<P>
"'To Parnesius and Pertinax, the not unworthy Captains of the Wall,
from Maximus, once Emperor of Gaul and Britain, now prisoner waiting
death by the sea in the camp of Theodosius&mdash;Greeting and Goodbye!"
</P>

<P>
"'Enough," said young Amal; "there is your proof! You must join us now!"
</P>

<P>
'Pertinax looked long and silently at him, till that fair man blushed
like a girl.  Then read Pertinax:
</P>

<P>
"'I have joyfully done much evil in my life to those who have wished me
evil, but if ever I did any evil to you two I repent, and I ask your
forgiveness.  The three mules which I strove to drive have torn me in
pieces as your Father prophesied.  The naked swords wait at the tent
door to give me the death I gave to Gratian.  Therefore I, your General
and your emperor, send you free and honourable dismissal from my
service, which you entered, not for money or office, but, as it makes
me warm to believe, because you loved me!"
</P>

<P>
"'By the Light of the Sun," Amal broke in.  "This was in some sort a
Man!  We may have been mistaken in his servants!"
</P>

<P>
'And Pertinax read on:  "You gave me the time for which I asked.  If I
have failed to use it, do not lament.  We have gambled very splendidly
against the Gods, but they hold weighted dice, and I must pay the
forfeit.  Remember, I have been; but Rome is; and Rome will be.  Tell
Pertinax his Mother is in safety at Nicaea, and her monies are in
charge of the Prefect at Antipolis. Make my remembrances to your Father
and to your Mother, whose friendship was great gain to me.  Give also
to my little Picts and to the Winged Hats such messages as their thick
heads can understand.  I would have sent you three Legions this very
day if all had gone aright.  Do not forget me.  We have worked
together.  Farewell!  Farewell!  Farewell!" 'Now, that was my Emperor's
last letter.'  (The children heard the parchment crackle as Parnesius
returned it to its place.)
</P>

<P>
"'I was mistaken," said Amal.  "The servants of such a man will sell
nothing except over the sword.  I am glad of it." He held out his hand
to me.
</P>

<P>
"'But Maximus has given you your dismissal," said an elder.  "You are
certainly free to serve&mdash;or to rule&mdash;whom you please.  Join&mdash;do not
follow&mdash;join us!"
</P>

<P>
"'We thank you," said Pertinax.  "But Maximus tells us to give you such
messages as&mdash;pardon me, but I use his words&mdash;your thick heads can
understand." He pointed through the door to the foot of a catapult
wound up.
</P>

<P>
"'We understand," said an elder.  "The Wall must be won at a price?"
</P>

<P>
"'It grieves me," said Pertinax, laughing, "but so it must be won," and
he gave them of our best Southern wine.
</P>

<P>
'They drank, and wiped their yellow beards in silence till they rose to
go.
</P>

<P>
'Said Amal, stretching himself (for they were barbarians): "We be a
goodly company; I wonder what the ravens and the dogfish will make of
some of us before this snow melts."
</P>

<P>
"'Think rather what Theodosius may send," I answered; and though they
laughed, I saw that my chance shot troubled them.
</P>

<P>
'Only old Allo lingered behind a little.
</P>

<P>
"'You see," he said, winking and blinking, "I am no more than their
dog.  When I have shown their men the secret short ways across our
bogs, they will kick me like one."
</P>

<P>
"'Then I should not be in haste to show them those ways," said
Pertinax, "till I was sure that Rome could not save the Wall."
</P>

<P>
"'You think so?  Woe is me!" said the old man.  "I only wanted peace
for my people," and he went out stumbling through the snow behind the
tall Winged Hats.
</P>

<P>
'In this fashion then, slowly, a day at a time, which is very bad for
doubting troops, the War came upon us.  At first the Winged Hats swept
in from the sea as they had done before, and there we met them as
before&mdash;with the catapults; and they sickened of it.  Yet for a long
time they would not trust their duck-legs on land, and I think, when it
came to revealing the secrets of the tribe, the little Picts were
afraid or ashamed to show them all the roads across the heather.  I had
this from a Pict prisoner.  They were as much our spies as our enemies,
for the Winged Hats oppressed them, and took their winter stores.  Ah,
foolish Little People!
</P>

<P>
'Then the Winged Hats began to roll us up from each end of the Wall.  I
sent runners Southward to see what the news might be in Britain, but
the wolves were very bold that winter, among the deserted stations
where the troops had once been, and none came back.  We had trouble,
too, with the forage for the ponies along the Wall.  I kept ten, and so
did Pertinax.  We lived and slept in the saddle, riding east or west,
and we ate our worn-out ponies.  The people of the town also made us
some trouble till I gathered them all in one quarter behind Hunno.  We
broke down the Wall on either side of it to make as it were a citadel.
Our men fought better in close order.
</P>

<P>
'By the end of the second month we were deep in the War as a man is
deep in a snowdrift, or in a dream.  I think we fought in our sleep.
At least I know I have gone on the Wall and come off again, remembering
nothing between, though my throat was harsh with giving orders, and my
sword, I could see, had been used.
</P>

<P>
'The Winged Hats fought like wolves&mdash;all in a pack. Where they had
suffered most, there they charged in most hotly.  This was hard for the
defenders, but it held them from sweeping on into Britain.
</P>

<P>
'In those days Pertinax and I wrote on the plaster of the bricked
archway into Valentia the names of the towers, and the days on which
they fell one by one.  We wished for some record.
</P>

<P>
'And the fighting?  The fight was always hottest to left and right of
the great statue of Roma Dea, near to Rutilianus's house.  By the Light
of the Sun, that old fat man, whom we had not considered at all, grew
young again among the trumpets!  I remember he said his sword was an
oracle!  "Let us consult the Oracle," he would say, and put the handle
against his ear, and shake his head wisely.  "And this day is allowed
Rutilianus to live," he would say, and, tucking up his cloak, he would
puff and pant and fight well.  Oh, there were jests in plenty on the
Wall to take the place of food!
</P>

<P>
'We endured for two months and seventeen days&mdash;always being pressed
from three sides into a smaller space.  Several times Allo sent in word
that help was at hand.  We did not believe it, but it cheered our men.
'The end came not with shootings of joy, but, like the rest, as in a
dream.  The Winged Hats suddenly left us in peace for one night and the
next day; which is too long for spent men.  We slept at first lightly,
expecting to be roused, and then like logs, each where he lay.  May you
never need such sleep!  When I waked our towers were full of strange,
armed men, who watched us snoring.  I roused Pertinax, and we leaped up
together.
</P>

<P>
"'What?" said a young man in clean armour.  "Do you fight against
Theodosius?  Look!"
</P>

<P>
'North we looked over the red snow.  No Winged Hats were there.  South
we looked over the white snow, and behold there were the Eagles of two
strong Legions encamped.  East and west we saw flame and fighting, but
by Hunno all was still.
</P>

<P>
"'Trouble no more," said the young man.  "Rome's arm is long.  Where
are the Captains of the Wall?"
</P>

<P>
'We said we were those men.
</P>

<P>
"'But you are old and grey-haired," he cried. "Maximus said that they
were boys."
</P>

<P>
"'Yes, that was true some years ago," said Pertinax. "What is our fate
to be, you fine and well-fed child?"
</P>

<P>
"'I am called Ambrosius, a secretary of the Emperor," he answered.
"Show me a certain letter which Maximus wrote from a tent at Aquileia,
and perhaps I will believe."
</P>

<P>
'I took it from my breast, and when he had read it he saluted us,
saying:  "Your fate is in your own hands.  If you choose to serve
Theodosius, he will give you a Legion.  If it suits you to go to your
homes, we will give you a Triumph."
</P>

<P>
"'I would like better a bath, wine, food, razors, soaps, oils, and
scents," said Pertinax, laughing.
</P>

<P>
"'Oh, I see you are a boy," said Ambrosius.  "And you?" turning to me.
</P>

<P>
"'We bear no ill-will against Theodosius, but in War-" I began.
</P>

<P>
"'In War it is as it is in Love," said Pertinax.  "Whether she be good
or bad, one gives one's best once, to one only.  That given, there
remains no second worth giving or taking."
</P>

<P>
"'That is true," said Ambrosius.  "I was with Maximus before he died.
He warned Theodosius that you would never serve him, and frankly I say
I am sorry for my Emperor."
</P>

<P>
"'He has Rome to console him," said Pertinax.  "I ask you of your
kindness to let us go to our homes and get this smell out of our
nostrils."
</P>

<P>
'None the less they gave us a Triumph!'
</P>

<P>
'It was well earned,' said Puck, throwing some leaves into the still
water of the marlpit.  The black, oily circles spread dizzily as the
children watched them.
</P>

<P>
'I want to know, oh, ever so many things,' said Dan. 'What happened to
old Allo?  Did the Winged Hats ever come back?  And what did Amal do?'
</P>

<P>
'And what happened to the fat old General with the five cooks?' said
Una.  'And what did your Mother say when you came home? ...'
</P>

<P>
'She'd say you're settin' too long over this old pit, so late as 'tis
already,' said old Hobden's voice behind them. 'Hst!' he whispered.
</P>

<P>
He stood still, for not twenty paces away a magnificent dog-fox sat on
his haunches and looked at the children as though he were an old friend
of theirs.
</P>

<P>
'Oh, Mus' Reynolds, Mus' Reynolds!' said Hobden, under his breath.  'If
I knowed all was inside your head, I'd know something wuth knowin'.
Mus' Dan an' Miss Una, come along o' me while I lock up my liddle
henhouse.'

A rainy afternoon drove Dan and Una over to play pirates in the Little
Mill.  If you don't mind rats on the rafters and oats in your shoes,
the mill-attic, with its trap-doors and inscriptions on beams about
floods and sweethearts, is a splendid place.  It is lighted by a
foot-square window, called Duck Window, that looks across to Little
Lindens Farm, and the spot where Jack Cade was killed.
</P>

<P>
When they had climbed the attic ladder (they called it 'the mainmast
tree', out of the ballad of Sir Andrew Barton, and Dan 'swarved it with
might and main', as the ballad says) they saw a man sitting on Duck
Window-sill. He was dressed in a plum-coloured doublet and tight
plum-coloured hose, and he drew busily in a red-edged book.
</P>

<P>
'Sit ye!  Sit ye!' Puck cried from a rafter overhead.  'See what it is
to be beautiful!  Sir Harry Dawe&mdash;pardon, Hal&mdash;says I am the very image
of a head for a gargoyle.'
</P>

<P>
The man laughed and raised his dark velvet cap to the children, and his
grizzled hair bristled out in a stormy fringe.  He was old&mdash;forty at
least&mdash;but his eyes were young, with funny little wrinkles all round
them.  A satchel of embroidered leather hung from his broad belt, which
looked interesting.
</P>

<P>
'May we see?' said Una, coming forward.
</P>

<P>
'Surely&mdash;sure-ly!' he said, moving up on the window-seat, and returned
to his work with a silver-pointed pencil.  Puck sat as though the grin
were fixed for ever on his broad face, while they watched the quick,
certain fingers that copied it.  Presently the man took a reed pen from
his satchel, and trimmed it with a little ivory knife, carved in the
semblance of a fish. 'Oh, what a beauty!' cried Dan.
</P>

<P>
''Ware fingers!  That blade is perilous sharp.  I made it myself of the
best Low Country cross-bow steel.  And so, too, this fish.  When his
back-fin travels to his tail&mdash;so&mdash;he swallows up the blade, even as the
whale swallowed Gaffer Jonah ...  Yes, and that's my inkhorn.  I made
the four silver saints round it.  Press Barnabas's head.  It opens, and
then&mdash;'He dipped the trimmed pen, and with careful boldness began to
put in the essential lines of Puck's rugged face, that had been but
faintly revealed by the silver-point.
</P>

<P>
The children gasped, for it fairly leaped from the page.
</P>

<P>
As he worked, and the rain fell on the tiles, he talked&mdash;now clearly,
now muttering, now breaking off to frown or smile at his work.  He told
them he was born at Little Lindens Farm, and his father used to beat
him for drawing things instead of doing things, till an old priest
called Father Roger, who drew illuminated letters in rich people's
books, coaxed the parents to let him take the boy as a sort of
painter's apprentice.  Then he went with Father Roger to Oxford, where
he cleaned plates and carried cloaks and shoes for the scholars of a
College called Merton.
</P>

<P>
'Didn't you hate that?' said Dan after a great many other questions.
</P>

<P>
'I never thought on't.  Half Oxford was building new colleges or
beautifying the old, and she had called to her aid the master-craftsmen
of all Christendie&mdash;kings in their trade and honoured of Kings.  I knew
them.  I worked for them:  that was enough.  No wonder&mdash;' He stopped
and laughed.
</P>

<P>
'You became a great man, Hal,' said Puck.
</P>

<P>
'They said so, Robin.  Even Bramante said so.'
</P>

<P>
'Why?  What did you do?' Dan asked.
</P>

<P>
The artist looked at him queerly.  'Things in stone and such, up and
down England.  You would not have heard of 'em.  To come nearer home, I
rebuilded this little St Barnabas' church of ours.  It cost me more
trouble and sorrow than aught I've touched in my life.  But 'twas a
sound lesson.'
</P>

<P>
'Um,' said Dan.  'We've had lessons this morning.'
</P>

<P>
'I'll not afflict ye, lad,' said Hal, while Puck roared. 'Only 'tis
strange to think how that little church was rebuilt, re-roofed, and
made glorious, thanks to some few godly Sussex ironmasters, a Bristow
sailor lad, a proud ass called Hal o' the Draft because, d'you see, he
was always drawing and drafting; and'&mdash;he dragged the words
slowly&mdash;'and a Scotch pirate.'
</P>

<P>
'Pirate?' said Dan.  He wriggled like a hooked fish.
</P>

<P>
'Even that Andrew Barton you were singing of on the stair just now.'
He dipped again in the inkwell, and held his breath over a sweeping
line, as though he had forgotten everything else.
</P>

<P>
'Pirates don't build churches, do they?' said Dan.  'Or do they?'
</P>

<P>
'They help mightily,' Hal laughed.  'But you were at your lessons this
morn, Jack Scholar.'
</P>

<P>
'Oh, pirates aren't lessons.  It was only Bruce and his silly old
spider,' said Una.  'Why did Sir Andrew Barton help you?' 'I question
if he ever knew it,' said Hal, twinkling. 'Robin, how a' mischief's
name am I to tell these innocents what comes of sinful pride?'
</P>

<P>
'Oh, we know all about that,' said Una pertly.  'If you get too
beany&mdash;that's cheeky&mdash;you get sat upon, of course.'
</P>

<P>
Hal considered a moment, pen in air, and Puck said some long words.
</P>

<P>
'Aha!  that was my case too,' he cried.  'Beany&mdash;you say&mdash;but certainly
I did not conduct myself well.  I was proud of&mdash;of such things as
porches&mdash;a Galilee porch at Lincoln for choice&mdash;proud of one
Torrigiano's arm on my shoulder, proud of my knighthood when I made the
gilt scroll-work for the Sovereign&mdash;our King's ship.  But Father Roger
sitting in Merton College Library, he did not forget me.  At the top of
my pride, when I and no other should have builded the porch at Lincoln,
he laid it on me with a terrible forefinger to go back to my Sussex
clays and rebuild, at my own charges, my own church, where us Dawes
have been buried for six generations.  "Out!  Son of my Art!" said he.
"Fight the Devil at home ere you call yourself a man and a craftsman."
And I quaked, and I went...  How's yon, Robin?'  He flourished the
finished sketch before Puck.
</P>

<P>
'Me!  Me past peradventure,' said Puck, smirking like a man at a
mirror.  'Ah, see!  The rain has took off!  I hate housen in daylight.'
</P>

<P>
'Whoop!  Holiday!' cried Hal, leaping up.  'Who's for my Little
Lindens?  We can talk there.'
</P>

<P>
They tumbled downstairs, and turned past the dripping willows by the
sunny mill-dam.
</P>

<P>
'Body o' me,' said Hal, staring at the hop-garden, where the hops were
just ready to blossom.  'What are these?  Vines?  No, not vines, and
they twine the wrong way to beans.'  He began to draw in his ready book.
</P>

<P>
'Hops.  New since your day,' said Puck.  'They're an herb of Mars, and
their flowers dried flavour ale.  We say&mdash;
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'Turkeys, Heresy, Hops, and Beer<BR>
     Came into England all in one year.'<BR>
</P>

<P>
'Heresy I know.  I've seen Hops&mdash;God be praised for their beauty!  What
is your Turkis?'
</P>

<P>
The children laughed.  They knew the Lindens turkeys, and as soon as
they reached Lindens orchard on the hill the full flock charged at them.
</P>

<P>
Out came Hal's book at once.  'Hoity-toity!' he cried. 'Here's Pride in
purple feathers!  Here's wrathy contempt and the Pomps of the Flesh!
How d'you call them?'
</P>

<P>
'Turkeys!  Turkeys!' the children shouted, as the old gobbler raved and
flamed against Hal's plum-coloured hose.
</P>

<P>
'Save Your Magnificence!' he said.  'I've drafted two good new things
today.'  And he doffed his cap to the bubbling bird.
</P>

<P>
Then they walked through the grass to the knoll where Little Lindens
stands.  The old farmhouse, weather-tiled to the ground, took almost
the colour of a blood-ruby in the afternoon light.  The pigeons pecked
at the mortar in the chimney-stacks; the bees that had lived under the
tiles since it was built filled the hot August air with their booming;
and the smell of the box-tree by the dairy-window mixed with the smell
of earth after rain, bread after baking, and a tickle of wood-smoke.
</P>

<P>
The farmer's wife came to the door, baby on arm, shaded her brows
against the sun, stooped to pluck a sprig of rosemary, and turned down
the orchard.  The old spaniel in his barrel barked once or twice to
show he was in charge of the empty house.  Puck clicked back the
garden-gate.
</P>

<P>
'D'you marvel that I love it?' said Hal, in a whisper. 'What can town
folk know of the nature of housen&mdash;or land?' They perched themselves
arow on the old hacked oak bench in Lindens garden, looking across the
valley of the brook at the fern-covered dimples and hollows of the
Forge behind Hobden's cottage.  The old man was cutting a faggot in his
garden by the hives.  It was quite a second after his chopper fell that
the chump of the blow reached their lazy ears.
</P>

<P>
'Eh&mdash;yeh!' said Hal.  'I mind when where that old gaffer stands was
Nether Forge&mdash;Master John Collins's foundry.  Many a night has his big
trip-hammer shook me in my bed here.  Boom-bitty!  Boom-bitty!  If the
wind was east, I could hear Master Tom Collins's forge at Stockens
answering his brother, Boom-oop!  Boom-oop!  and midway between, Sir
John Pelham's sledgehammers at Brightling would strike in like a pack
o' scholars, and "Hic-haec-hoc" they'd say, "Hic-haec-hoc," till I fell
asleep.  Yes.  The valley was as full o' forges and fineries as a May
shaw o' cuckoos.  All gone to grass now!'
</P>

<P>
'What did they make?' said Dan. 'Guns for the King's ships&mdash;and for
others.  Serpentines and cannon mostly.  When the guns were cast, down
would come the King's Officers, and take our plough-oxen to haul them
to the coast.  Look!  Here's one of the first and finest craftsmen of
the Sea!'
</P>

<P>
He fluttered back a page of his book, and showed them a young man's
head.  Underneath was written: 'Sebastianus.'
</P>

<P>
'He came down with a King's Order on Master John Collins for twenty
serpentines (wicked little cannon they be!) to furnish a venture of
ships.  I drafted him thus sitting by our fire telling Mother of the
new lands he'd find the far side the world.  And he found them, too!
There's a nose to cleave through unknown seas!  Cabot was his name&mdash;a
Bristol lad&mdash;half a foreigner.  I set a heap by him.  He helped me to
my church-building.'
</P>

<P>
'I thought that was Sir Andrew Barton,' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Ay, but foundations before roofs,' Hal answered. 'Sebastian first put
me in the way of it.  I had come down here, not to serve God as a
craftsman should, but to show my people how great a craftsman I was.
They cared not, and it served me right, one split straw for my craft or
my greatness.  What a murrain call had I, they said, to mell with old
St Barnabas'?  Ruinous the church had been since the Black Death, and
ruinous she would remain; and I could hang myself in my new
scaffold-ropes!  Gentle and simple, high and low&mdash;the Hayes, the
Fowles, the Fenners, the Collinses&mdash;they were all in a tale against me.
Only Sir John Pelham up yonder at Brightling bade me heart-up and go
on.  Yet how could I?  Did I ask Master Collins for his timber-tug to
haul beams?  The oxen had gone to Lewes after lime.  Did he promise me
a set of iron cramps or ties for the roof?  They never came to hand, or
else they were spaulty or cracked.  So with everything. Nothing said,
but naught done except I stood by them, and then done amiss.  I thought
the countryside was fair bewitched.'
</P>

<P>
'It was, sure-ly,' said Puck, knees under chin.  'Did you never suspect
ary one?'
</P>

<P>
'Not till Sebastian came for his guns, and John Collins played him the
same dog's tricks as he'd played me with my ironwork.  Week in, week
out, two of three serpentines would be flawed in the casting, and only
fit, they said, to be re-melted.  Then John Collins would shake his
head, and vow he could pass no cannon for the King's service that were
not perfect.  Saints!  How Sebastian stormed!  I know, for we sat on
this bench sharing our sorrows inter-common.
</P>

<P>
'When Sebastian had fumed away six weeks at Lindens and gotten just six
serpentines, Dirk Brenzett, Master of the Cygnet hoy, sends me word
that the block of stone he was fetching me from France for our new font
he'd hove overboard to lighten his ship, chased by Andrew Barton up to
Rye Port.'
</P>

<P>
'Ah!  The pirate!' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Yes.  And while I am tearing my hair over this, Ticehurst Will, my
best mason, comes to me shaking, and vowing that the Devil, horned,
tailed, and chained, has run out on him from the church-tower, and the
men would work there no more.  So I took 'em off the foundations, which
we were strengthening, and went into the Bell Tavern for a cup of ale.
Says Master John Collins: "Have it your own way, lad; but if I was you,
I'd take the sinnification o' the sign, and leave old Barnabas' Church
alone!" And they all wagged their sinful heads, and agreed.  Less
afraid of the Devil than of me&mdash;as I saw later.
</P>

<P>
'When I brought my sweet news to Lindens, Sebastian was limewashing the
kitchen-beams for Mother.  He loved her like a son.
</P>

<P>
"'Cheer up, lad," he says.  "God's where He was.  Only you and I chance
to be pure pute asses.  We've been tricked, Hal, and more shame to me,
a sailor, that I did not guess it before!  You must leave your belfry
alone, forsooth, because the Devil is adrift there; and I cannot get my
serpentines because John Collins cannot cast them aright.  Meantime
Andrew Barton hawks off the Port of Rye.  And why?  To take those very
serpentines which poor Cabot must whistle for; the said serpentines,
I'll wager my share of new continents, being now hid away in St
Barnabas' church-tower.  Clear as the Irish coast at noonday!"
</P>

<P>
"They'd sure never dare to do it," I said; "and, for another thing,
selling cannon to the King's enemies is black treason&mdash;hanging and
fine."
</P>

<P>
"'It is sure, large profit.  Men'll dare any gallows for that.  I have
been a trader myself," says he.  "We must be upsides with 'em for the
honour of Bristol."
</P>

<P>
'Then he hatched a plot, sitting on the limewash bucket.  We gave out
to ride o' Tuesday to London and made a show of taking farewells of our
friends&mdash;especially of Master John Collins.  But at Wadhurst Woods we
turned; rode home to the water-meadows; hid our horses in a willow-tot
at the foot of the glebe, and, come night, stole a-tiptoe uphill to
Barnabas' church again.  A thick mist, and a moon striking through. 'I
had no sooner locked the tower-door behind us than over goes Sebastian
full length in the dark.
</P>

<P>
"'Pest!" he says.  "Step high and feel low, Hal.  I've stumbled over
guns before."
</P>

<P>
'I groped, and one by one&mdash;the tower was pitchy dark&mdash;I counted the
lither barrels of twenty serpentines laid out on pease straw.  No
conceal at all!
</P>

<P>
"'There's two demi-cannon my end," says Sebastian, slapping metal.
"They'll be for Andrew Barton's lower deck.  Honest&mdash;honest John
Collins!  So this is his ware-house, his arsenal, his armoury!  Now see
you why your pokings and pryings have raised the Devil in Sussex?
You've hindered John's lawful trade for months," and he laughed where
he lay.
</P>

<P>
'A clay-cold tower is no fireside at midnight, so we climbed the belfry
stairs, and there Sebastian trips over a cow-hide with its horns and
tail.
</P>

<P>
"'Aha!  Your Devil has left his doublet!  Does it become me, Hal?"  He
draws it on and capers in the shafts of window-moonlight&mdash;won'erful
devilish-like.  Then he sits on the stairs, rapping with his tail on a
board, and his back-aspect was dreader than his front, and a howlet lit
in, and screeched at the horns of him.
</P>

<P>
"'If you'd keep out the Devil, shut the door," he whispered.  "And
that's another false proverb, Hal, for I can hear your tower-door
opening."
</P>

<P>
"'I locked it.  Who a-plague has another key, then?" I said.
</P>

<P>
"'All the congregation, to judge by their feet," he says, and peers
into the blackness.  "Still!  Still, Hal!  Hear 'em grunt!  That's more
o' my serpentines, I'll be bound. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four they bear in!
Faith, Andrew equips himself like an Admiral!  Twenty-four serpentines
in all!"
</P>

<P>
'As if it had been an echo, we heard John Collins's voice come up all
hollow:  "Twenty-four serpentines and two demi-cannon.  That's the full
tally for Sir Andrew Barton."
</P>

<P>
"'Courtesy costs naught," whispers Sebastian.  "Shall I drop my dagger
on his head?"
</P>

<P>
"'They go over to Rye o' Thursday in the wool-wains, hid under the
wool-packs.  Dirk Brenzett meets them at Udimore, as before," says John.
</P>

<P>
"'Lord!  What a worn, handsmooth trade it is!" says Sebastian.  "I lay
we are the sole two babes in the village that have not our lawful share
in the venture."
</P>

<P>
'There was a full score folk below, talking like all Robertsbridge
Market.  We counted them by voice.
</P>

<P>
'Master John Collins pipes:  "The guns for the French carrack must lie
here next month.  Will, when does your young fool" (me, so please you!)
"come back from Lunnon?"
</P>

<P>
"'No odds," I heard Ticehurst Will answer.  "Lay 'em just where you've
a mind, Mus' Collins.  We're all too afraid o' the Devil to mell with
the tower now." And the long knave laughed.
</P>

<P>
"'Ah!  'tis easy enow for you to raise the Devil, Will," says
another&mdash;Ralph Hobden of the Forge.
</P>

<P>
"'Aaa-men!" roars Sebastian, and ere I could hold him, he leaps down
the stairs&mdash;won'erful devilish-like howling no bounds.  He had scarce
time to lay out for the nearest than they ran.  Saints, how they ran!
We heard them pound on the door of the Bell Tavern, and then we ran too.
</P>

<P>
"'What's next?" says Sebastian, looping up his cow-tail as he leaped
the briars.  "I've broke honest John's face."
</P>

<P>
"'Ride to Sir John Pelham's," I said.  "He is the only one that ever
stood by me."
</P>

<P>
'We rode to Brightling, and past Sir John's lodges, where the keepers
would have shot at us for deer-stealers, and we had Sir John down into
his Justice's chair, and when we had told him our tale and showed him
the cow-hide which Sebastian wore still girt about him, he laughed till
the tears ran.
</P>

<P>
"'Wel-a-well!" he says.  "I'll see justice done before daylight.
What's your complaint?  Master Collins is my old friend."
</P>

<P>
"'He's none of mine," I cried.  "When I think how he and his likes have
baulked and dozened and cozened me at every turn over the church"&mdash;and
I choked at the thought.
</P>

<P>
"'Ah, but ye see now they needed it for another use," says he smoothly.
</P>

<P>
"Also they did my serpentines," Sebastian cries.  "I should be half
across the Western Ocean by now if my guns had been ready.  But they're
sold to a Scotch pirate by your old friend&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"'Where's your proof?" says Sir John, stroking his beard.
</P>

<P>
"'I broke my shins over them not an hour since, and I heard John give
order where they were to be taken," says Sebastian.
</P>

<P>
"'Words!  Words only," says Sir John.  "Master Collins is somewhat of a
liar at best."
</P>

<P>
'He carried it so gravely that, for the moment, I thought he was dipped
in this secret traffick too, and that there was not an honest
ironmaster in Sussex.
</P>

<P>
"'Name o' Reason!" says Sebastian, and raps with his cow-tail on the
table, "whose guns are they, then?"
</P>

<P>
"'Yours, manifestly," says Sir John.  "You come with the King's Order
for 'em, and Master Collins casts them in his foundry.  If he chooses
to bring them up from Nether Forge and lay 'em out in the church-tower,
why, they are e'en so much the nearer to the main road and you are
saved a day's hauling.  What a coil to make of a mere act of
neighbourly kindness, lad!"
</P>

<P>
"'I fear I have requited him very scurvily," says Sebastian, looking at
his knuckles.  "But what of the demi-cannon?  I could do with 'em well,
but they are not in the King's Order."
</P>

<P>
"'Kindness&mdash;loving-kindness," says Sir John.  "Questionless, in his
zeal for the King and his love for you, John adds those two cannon as a
gift.  'Tis plain as this coming daylight, ye stockfish!"
</P>

<P>
"'So it is," says Sebastian.  "Oh, Sir John, Sir John, why did you
never use the sea?  You are lost ashore." And he looked on him with
great love.
</P>

<P>
"'I do my best in my station." Sir John strokes his beard again and
rolls forth his deep drumming Justice's voice thus:  "But&mdash;suffer
me!&mdash;-you two lads, on some midnight frolic into which I probe not,
roystering around the taverns, surprise Master Collins at his"&mdash;he
thinks a moment&mdash;"at his good deeds done by stealth.  Ye surprise him,
I say, cruelly."
</P>

<P>
"'Truth, Sir John.  If you had seen him run!" says Sebastian.
</P>

<P>
"'On this you ride breakneck to me with a tale of pirates, and
wool-wains, and cow-hides, which, though it hath moved my mirth as a
man, offendeth my reason as a magistrate.  So I will e'en accompany you
back to the tower with, perhaps, some few of my own people, and
three-four wagons, and I'll be your warrant that Master John Collins
will freely give you your guns and your demi-cannon, Master Sebastian."
He breaks into his proper voice&mdash;"I warned the old tod and his
neighbours long ago that they'd come to trouble with their
side-sellings and bye-dealings; but we cannot have half Sussex hanged
for a little gun-running.  Are ye content, lads?"
</P>

<P>
"'I'd commit any treason for two demi-cannon,' said Sebastian, and rubs
his hands.
</P>

<P>
"Ye have just compounded with rank treason-felony for the same bribe,"
says Sir John.  "Wherefore to horse, and get the guns."'
</P>

<P>
'But Master Collins meant the guns for Sir Andrew Barton all along,
didn't he?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Questionless, that he did,' said Hal.  'But he lost them. We poured
into the village on the red edge of dawn, Sir John horsed, in
half-armour, his pennon flying; behind him thirty stout Brightling
knaves, five abreast; behind them four wool-wains, and behind them four
trumpets to triumph over the jest, blowing:  Our King went forth to
Normandie.  When we halted and rolled the ringing guns out of the
tower, 'twas for all the world like Friar Roger's picture of the French
siege in the Queen's Missal-book.'
</P>

<P>
'And what did we&mdash;I mean, what did our village do?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Oh!  Bore it nobly&mdash;nobly,' cried Hal.  'Though they had tricked me, I
was proud of them.  They came out of their housen, looked at that
little army as though it had been a post, and went their shut-mouthed
way.  Never a sign!  Never a word!  They'd ha' perished sooner than let
Brightling overcrow us.  Even that villain, Ticehurst Will, coming out
of the Bell for his morning ale, he all but runs under Sir John's horse.
</P>

<P>
"''Ware, Sirrah Devil!" cries Sir John, reining back.
</P>

<P>
"'Oh!" says Will.  "Market-day, is it?  And all the bullocks from
Brightling here?"
</P>

<P>
'I spared him his belting for that&mdash;the brazen knave!
</P>

<P>
'But John Collins was our masterpiece!  He happened along-street (his
jaw tied up where Sebastian had clouted him) when we were trundling the
first demi-cannon through the lych-gate.
</P>

<P>
"'I reckon you'll find her middlin' heavy," he says.  "If you've a mind
to pay, I'll loan ye my timber-tug.  She won't lie easy on ary
wool-wain."
</P>

<P>
'That was the one time I ever saw Sebastian taken flat aback.  He
opened and shut his mouth, fishy-like.
</P>

<P>
"'No offence," says Master John.  "You've got her reasonable good
cheap.  I thought ye might not grudge me a groat if I helped move her."
Ah, he was a masterpiece! They say that morning's work cost our John
two hundred pounds, and he never winked an eyelid, not even when he saw
the guns all carted off to Lewes.'
</P>

<P>
'Neither then nor later?' said Puck.
</P>

<P>
'Once.  'Twas after he gave St Barnabas' the new chime of bells.  (Oh,
there was nothing the Collinses, or the Hayes, or the Fowles, or the
Fenners would not do for the church then!  "Ask and have" was their
song.) We had rung 'em in, and he was in the tower with Black Nick
Fowle, that gave us our rood-screen.  The old man pinches the bell-rope
one hand and scratches his neck with t'other.  "Sooner she was pulling
yon clapper than my neck, he says.  That was all!  That was Sussex
seely Sussex for everlasting.'
</P>

<P>
'And what happened after?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'I went back into England,' said Hal, slowly.  'I'd had my lesson
against pride.  But they tell me I left St Barnabas' a jewel&mdash;just
about a jewel!  Wel-a-well!  'Twas done for and among my own people,
and&mdash;Father Roger was right&mdash;I never knew such trouble or such triumph
since.  That's the nature o' things.  A dear&mdash;dear land.'  He dropped
his chin on his chest.
</P>

<P>
'There's your Father at the Forge.  What's he talking to old Hobden
about?' said Puck, opening his hand with three leaves in it.
</P>

<P>
Dan looked towards the cottage.
</P>

<P>
'Oh, I know.  It's that old oak lying across the brook. Pater always
wants it grubbed.'
</P>

<P>
In the still valley they could hear old Hobden's deep tones.
</P>

<P>
'Have it as you've a mind to,' he was saying.  'But the vivers of her
roots they hold the bank together.  If you grub her out, the bank
she'll all come tearin' down, an' next floods the brook'll swarve up.
But have it as you've a mind.  The Mistuss she sets a heap by the ferns
on her trunk.
</P>

<P>
'Oh!  I'll think it over,' said the Pater.
</P>

<P>
Una laughed a little bubbling chuckle.
</P>

<P>
'What Devil's in that belfry?' said Hal, with a lazy laugh.  'That
should be a Hobden by his voice.'
</P>

<P>
'Why, the oak is the regular bridge for all the rabbits between the
Three Acre and our meadow.  The best place for wires on the farm,
Hobden says.  He's got two there now,' Una answered.  'He won't ever
let it be grubbed!'
</P>

<P>
'Ah, Sussex!  Seely Sussex for everlastin',' murmured Hal; and the next
moment their Father's voice calling across to Little Lindens broke the
spell as little St Barnabas' clock struck five.

Just at dusk, a soft September rain began to fall on the hop-pickers.
The mothers wheeled the bouncing perambulators out of the gardens; bins
were put away, and tally-books made up.  The young couples strolled
home, two to each umbrella, and the single men walked behind them
laughing.  Dan and Una, who had been picking after their lessons,
marched off to roast potatoes at the oast-house, where old Hobden, with
Blue-eyed Bess, his lurcher dog, lived all the month through, drying
the hops.
</P>

<P>
They settled themselves, as usual, on the sack-strewn cot in front of
the fires, and, when Hobden drew up the shutter, stared, as usual, at
the flameless bed of coals spouting its heat up the dark well of the
old-fashioned roundel.  Slowly he cracked off a few fresh pieces of
coal, packed them, with fingers that never flinched, exactly where they
would do most good; slowly he reached behind him till Dan tilted the
potatoes into his iron scoop of a hand; carefully he arranged them
round the fire, and then stood for a moment, black against the glare.
As he closed the shutter, the oast-house seemed dark before the day's
end, and he lit the candle in the lanthorn.  The children liked all
these things because they knew them so well.

<P>
The Bee Boy, Hobden's son, who is not quite right in his head, though
he can do anything with bees, slipped in like a shadow.  They only
guessed it when Bess's stump-tail wagged against them.
</P>

<P>
A big voice began singing outside in the drizzle:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'Old Mother Laidinwool had nigh twelve months been dead,<BR>
     She heard the hops were doin' well, and then popped up her head.'<BR>
</P>

<P>
'There can't be two people made to holler like that!' cried old Hobden,
wheeling round.
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'For, says she, "The boys I've picked with when I was young and fair,<BR>
     They're bound to be at hoppin', and I'm&mdash;'<BR>
</P>

<P>
A man showed at the doorway.
</P>

<P>
'Well, well!  They do say hoppin' 'll draw the very deadest, and now I
belieft 'em.  You, Tom?  Tom Shoesmith?' Hobden lowered his lanthorn.
</P>

<P>
'You're a hem of a time makin' your mind to it, Ralph!' The stranger
strode in&mdash;three full inches taller than Hobden, a grey-whiskered,
brown-faced giant with clear blue eyes.  They shook hands, and the
children could hear the hard palms rasp together.
</P>

<P>
'You ain't lost none o' your grip,' said Hobden.  'Was it thirty or
forty year back you broke my head at Peasmarsh Fair?'
</P>

<P>
'Only thirty, an' no odds 'tween us regardin' heads, neither.  You had
it back at me with a hop-pole.  How did we get home that night?
Swimmin'?'
</P>

<P>
'Same way the pheasant come into Gubbs's pocket&mdash;by a little luck an' a
deal o' conjurin'.'  Old Hobden laughed in his deep chest.
</P>

<P>
see you've not forgot your way about the woods. D'ye do any o' this
still?'  The stranger pretended to look along a gun.
</P>

<P>
Hobden answered with a quick movement of the hand as though he were
pegging down a rabbit-wire.
</P>

<P>
'No.  That's all that's left me now.  Age she must as Age she can.  An'
what's your news since all these years?'
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'Oh, I've bin to Plymouth, I've bin to Dover&mdash;<BR>
     I've bin ramblin', boys, the wide world over,'<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
the man answered cheerily.  'I reckon I know as much of Old England as
most.'  He turned towards the children and winked boldly.
</P>

<P>
'I lay they told you a sight o' lies, then.  I've been into England fur
as Wiltsheer once.  I was cheated proper over a pair of
hedgin'-gloves,' said Hobden.
</P>

<P>
'There's fancy-talkin' everywhere.  You've cleaved to your own parts
pretty middlin' close, Ralph.'
</P>

<P>
'Can't shift an old tree 'thout it dyin',' Hobden chuckled.  'An' I be
no more anxious to die than you look to be to help me with my hops
tonight.'
</P>

<P>
The great man leaned against the brickwork of the roundel, and swung
his arms abroad.  'Hire me!' was all he said, and they stumped upstairs
laughing.
</P>

<P>
The children heard their shovels rasp on the cloth where the yellow
hops lie drying above the fires, and all the oast-house filled with the
sweet, sleepy smell as they were turned.
</P>

<P>
'Who is it?' Una whispered to the Bee Boy.
</P>

<P>
'Dunno, no more'n you&mdash;if you dunno,' said he, and smiled.
</P>

<P>
The voices on the drying-floor talked and chuckled together, and the
heavy footsteps moved back and forth. Presently a hop-pocket dropped
through the press-hole overhead, and stiffened and fattened as they
shovelled it full.  'Clank!' went the press, and rammed the loose stuff
into tight cake. 'Gentle!' they heard Hobden cry.  'You'll bust her
crop if you lay on so.  You be as careless as Gleason's bull, Tom.
Come an' sit by the fires.  She'll do now.'
</P>

<P>
They came down, and as Hobden opened the shutter to see if the potatoes
were done Tom Shoesmith said to the children, 'Put a plenty salt on
'em.  That'll show you the sort o' man I be.'Again he winked, and again
the Bee Boy laughed and Una stared at Dan.
</P>

<P>
'I know what sort o' man you be,'old Hobden grunted, groping for the
potatoes round the fire.
</P>

<P>
'Do ye?' Tom went on behind his back.  'Some of us can't abide
Horseshoes, or Church Bells, or Running Water; an', talkin' o' runnin'
water'&mdash;he turned to Hobden, who was backing out of the roundel&mdash;'d'you
mind the great floods at Robertsbridge, when the miller's man was
drowned in the street?'
</P>

<P>
'Middlin' well.'  Old Hobden let himself down on the coals by the
fire-door.  'I was courtin' my woman on the Marsh that year.  Carter to
Mus' Plum I was, gettin' ten shillin's week.  Mine was a Marsh woman.'
</P>

<P>
'Won'erful odd-gates place&mdash;Romney Marsh,' said Tom Shoesmith.  'I've
heard say the world's divided like into Europe, Ashy, Afriky, Ameriky,
Australy, an' Romney Marsh.'
</P>

<P>
'The Marsh folk think so,' said Hobden.  'I had a hem o' trouble to get
my woman to leave it.'
</P>

<P>
'Where did she come out of?  I've forgot, Ralph.'
</P>

<P>
'Dymchurch under the Wall,' Hobden answered, a potato in his hand.
</P>

<P>
'Then she'd be a Pett&mdash;or a Whitgift, would she?'
</P>

<P>
'Whitgift.'  Hobden broke open the potato and ate it with the curious
neatness of men who make most of their meals in the blowy open.  'She
growed to be quite reasonable-like after livin' in the Weald awhile,
but our first twenty year or two she was odd-fashioned, no bounds.  And
she was a won'erful hand with bees.'  He cut away a little piece of
potato and threw it out to the door.
</P>

<P>
'Ah!  I've heard say the Whitgifts could see further through a
millstone than most,' said Shoesmith.  'Did she, now?'
</P>

<P>
'She was honest-innocent of any nigromancin',' said Hobden.  'Only
she'd read signs and sinnifications out o' birds flyin', stars fallin',
bees hivin', and such.  An, she'd lie awake&mdash;listenin' for calls, she
said.'
</P>

<P>
'That don't prove naught,' said Tom.  'All Marsh folk has been
smugglers since time everlastin'.  'Twould be in her blood to listen
out o' nights.'
</P>

<P>
'Nature-ally,' old Hobden replied, smiling.  'I mind when there was
smugglin' a sight nearer us than what the Marsh be.  But that wasn't my
woman's trouble. 'Twas a passel o' no-sense talk'&mdash;he dropped his
voice&mdash;'about Pharisees.'
</P>

<P>
'Yes.  I've heard Marsh men belieft in 'em.'Tom looked straight at the
wide-eyed children beside Bess.
</P>

<P>
'Pharisees,' cried Una.  'Fairies?  Oh, I see!'
</P>

<P>
'People o' the Hills,' said the Bee Boy, throwing half of his potato
towards the door.
</P>

<P>
'There you be!' said Hobden, pointing at him.  My boy&mdash;he has her eyes
and her out-gate sense.  That's what she called 'em!'
</P>

<P>
'And what did you think of it all?'
</P>

<P>
'Um&mdash;um,' Hobden rumbled.  'A man that uses fields an' shaws after dark
as much as I've done, he don't go out of his road excep' for keepers.'
</P>

<P>
'But settin' that aside?' said Tom, coaxingly.  'I saw ye throw the
Good Piece out-at-doors just now.  Do ye believe or&mdash;do ye?'
</P>

<P>
'There was a great black eye to that tater,' said Hobden indignantly.
</P>

<P>
'My liddle eye didn't see un, then.  It looked as if you meant it
for&mdash;for Any One that might need it.  But settin' that aside, d'ye
believe or&mdash;do ye?'
</P>

<P>
'I ain't sayin' nothin', because I've heard naught, an' I've see
naught.  But if you was to say there was more things after dark in the
shaws than men, or fur, or feather, or fin, I dunno as I'd go far about
to call you a liar. Now turn again, Tom.  What's your say?'
</P>

<P>
'I'm like you.  I say nothin'.  But I'll tell you a tale, an' you can
fit it as how you please.'
</P>

<P>
'Passel o' no-sense stuff,' growled Hobden, but he filled his pipe.
</P>

<P>
'The Marsh men they call it Dymchurch Flit,'Tom went on slowly.  'Hap
you have heard it?'
</P>

<P>
'My woman she've told it me scores o' times.  Dunno as I didn't end by
belieftin' it&mdash;sometimes.
</P>

<P>
Hobden crossed over as he spoke, and sucked with his pipe at the yellow
lanthorn flame.  Tom rested one great elbow on one great knee, where he
sat among the coal.
</P>

<P>
'Have you ever bin in the Marsh?' he said to Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Only as far as Rye, once,' Dan answered.
</P>

<P>
'Ah, that's but the edge.  Back behind of her there's steeples settin'
beside churches, an' wise women settin' beside their doors, an' the sea
settin' above the land, an' ducks herdin' wild in the diks' (he meant
ditches).  'The Marsh is just about riddled with diks an' sluices, an'
tide-gates an' water-lets.  You can hear 'em bubblin' an' grummelin'
when the tide works in 'em, an' then you hear the sea rangin' left and
right-handed all up along the Wall.  You've seen how flat she is&mdash;the
Marsh?  You'd think nothin' easier than to walk eend-on acrost her?
Ah, but the diks an' the water-lets, they twists the roads about as
ravelly as witch-yarn on the spindles.  So ye get all turned round in
broad daylight.'
</P>

<P>
'That's because they've dreened the waters into the diks,' said Hobden.
'When I courted my woman the rushes was green&mdash;Eh me!  the rushes was
green&mdash;an' the Bailiff o' the Marshes he rode up and down as free as
the fog.'
</P>

<P>
'Who was he?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Why, the Marsh fever an' ague.  He've clapped me on the shoulder once
or twice till I shook proper.  But now the dreenin' off of the waters
have done away with the fevers; so they make a joke, like, that the
Bailiff o' the Marshes broke his neck in a dik.  A won'erful place for
bees an' ducks 'tis too.'
</P>

<P>
'An' old,' Tom went on.  'Flesh an' Blood have been there since Time
Everlastin' Beyond.  Well, now, speakin' among themselves, the Marsh
men say that from Time Everlastin' Beyond, the Pharisees favoured the
Marsh above the rest of Old England.  I lay the Marsh men ought to
know.  They've been out after dark, father an' son, smugglin' some one
thing or t'other, since ever wool grew to sheep's backs.  They say
there was always a middlin' few Pharisees to be seen on the Marsh.
Impident as rabbits, they was.  They'd dance on the nakid roads in the
nakid daytime; they'd flash their liddle green lights along the diks,
comin' an' goin', like honest smugglers.  Yes, an' times they'd lock
the church doors against parson an' clerk of Sundays.'
</P>

<P>
'That 'ud be smugglers layin' in the lace or the brandy till they could
run it out o' the Marsh.  I've told my woman so,' said Hobden.
</P>

<P>
'I'll lay she didn't belieft it, then&mdash;not if she was a Whitgift.  A
won'erful choice place for Pharisees, the Marsh, by all accounts, till
Queen Bess's father he come in with his Reformatories.'
</P>

<P>
'Would that be a Act of Parliament like?' Hobden asked.
</P>

<P>
'Sure-ly.  Can't do nothing in Old England without Act, Warrant an'
Summons.  He got his Act allowed him, an', they say, Queen Bess's
father he used the parish churches something shameful.  Just about tore
the gizzards out of I dunnamany.  Some folk in England they held with
'en; but some they saw it different, an' it eended in 'em takin' sides
an' burnin' each other no bounds, accordin' which side was top, time
bein'.  That tarrified the Pharisees:  for Goodwill among Flesh an'
Blood is meat an' drink to 'em, an' ill-will is poison.'
</P>

<P>
'Same as bees,' said the Bee Boy.  'Bees won't stay by a house where
there's hating.'
</P>

<P>
'True,' said Tom.  'This Reformatories tarrified the Pharisees same as
the reaper goin' round a last stand o' wheat tarrifies rabbits.  They
packed into the Marsh from all parts, and they says, "Fair or foul, we
must flit out o' this, for Merry England's done with, an' we're
reckoned among the Images."'
</P>

<P>
'Did they all see it that way?' said Hobden.
</P>

<P>
'All but one that was called Robin&mdash;if you've heard of him.  What are
you laughin' at?'Tom turned to Dan.  'The Pharisees's trouble didn't
tech Robin, because he'd cleaved middlin' close to people, like.  No
more he never meant to go out of Old England&mdash;not he; so he was sent
messagin' for help among Flesh an' Blood.  But Flesh an' Blood must
always think of their own concerns, an' Robin couldn't get through at
'em, ye see.  They thought it was tide-echoes off the Marsh.'
</P>

<P>
'What did you&mdash;what did the fai&mdash;Pharisees want?' Una asked.
</P>

<P>
'A boat, to be sure.  Their liddle wings could no more cross Channel
than so many tired butterflies.  A boat an' a crew they desired to sail
'em over to France, where yet awhile folks hadn't tore down the Images.
They couldn't abide cruel Canterbury Bells ringin' to Bulverhithe for
more pore men an' women to be burnded, nor the King's proud messenger
ridin' through the land givin' orders to tear down the Images.  They
couldn't abide it no shape. Nor yet they couldn't get their boat an'
crew to flit by without Leave an' Good-will from Flesh an' Blood; an'
Flesh an' Blood came an' went about its own business the while the
Marsh was swarvin' up, an' swarvin' up with Pharisees from all England
over, strivin' all means to get through at Flesh an' Blood to tell 'em
their sore need...  I don't know as you've ever heard say Pharisees are
like chickens?'
</P>

<P>
'My woman used to say that too,'said Hobden, folding his brown arms.
</P>

<P>
'They be.  You run too many chickens together, an' the ground sickens,
like, an' you get a squat, an' your chickens die.  Same way, you crowd
Pharisees all in one place&mdash;they don't die, but Flesh an' Blood walkin'
among 'em is apt to sick up an' pine off.  They don't mean it, an'
Flesh an' Blood don't know it, but that's the truth&mdash;as I've heard.
The Pharisees through bein' all stenched up an' frighted, an' trying'
to come through with their supplications, they nature-ally changed the
thin airs an' humours in Flesh an' Blood.  It lay on the Marsh like
thunder.  Men saw their churches ablaze with the wildfire in the
windows after dark; they saw their cattle scatterin' an' no man
scarin'; their sheep flockin' an' no man drivin'; their horses
latherin' an' no man leadin'; they saw the liddle low green lights more
than ever in the dik-sides; they heard the liddle feet patterin' more
than ever round the houses; an' night an' day, day an' night, 'twas all
as though they were bein' creeped up on, an' hinted at by Some One or
other that couldn't rightly shape their trouble.  Oh, I lay they
sweated!  Man an' maid, woman an' child, their nature done 'em no
service all the weeks while the Marsh was swarvin' up with Pharisees.
But they was Flesh an' Blood, an' Marsh men before all.  They reckoned
the signs sinnified trouble for the Marsh.  Or that the sea 'ud rear up
against Dymchurch Wall an' they'd be drownded like Old Winchelsea; or
that the Plague was comin'.  So they looked for the meanin' in the sea
or in the clouds&mdash;far an' high up. They never thought to look near an'
knee-high, where they could see naught.
</P>

<P>
'Now there was a poor widow at Dymchurch under the Wall, which, lacking
man or property, she had the more time for feeling; and she come to
feel there was a Trouble outside her doorstep bigger an' heavier than
aught she'd ever carried over it.  She had two sons&mdash;one born blind,
an' t'other struck dumb through fallin' off the Wall when he was
liddle.  They was men grown, but not wage-earnin', an' she worked for
'em, keepin' bees and answerin' Questions.'
</P>

<P>
'What sort of questions?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'Like where lost things might be found, an' what to put about a crooked
baby's neck, an' how to join parted sweethearts.  She felt the Trouble
on the Marsh same as eels feel thunder.  She was a wise woman.'
</P>

<P>
'My woman was won'erful weather-tender, too,' said Hobden.  'I've seen
her brish sparks like off an anvil out of her hair in thunderstorms.
But she never laid out to answer Questions.'
</P>

<P>
'This woman was a Seeker, like, an' Seekers they sometimes find.  One
night, while she lay abed, hot an' achin', there come a Dream an'
tapped at her window, an' "Widow Whitgift," it said, "Widow Whitgift!"
</P>

<P>
'First, by the wings an' the whistlin', she thought it was peewits, but
last she arose an' dressed herself, an' opened her door to the Marsh,
an' she felt the Trouble an' the Groanin' all about her, strong as
fever an' ague, an' she calls:  "What is it?  Oh, what is it?"
</P>

<P>
'Then 'twas all like the frogs in the diks peepin'; then 'twas all like
the reeds in the diks clip-clappin'; an' then the great Tide-wave
rummelled along the Wall, an' she couldn't hear proper.
</P>

<P>
'Three times she called, an' three times the Tide-wave did her down.
But she catched the quiet between, an' she cries out, "What is the
Trouble on the Marsh that's been lying down with my heart an' arising
with my body this month gone?"  She felt a liddle hand lay hold on her
gown-hem, an' she stooped to the pull o' that liddle hand.'
</P>

<P>
Tom Shoesmith spread his huge fist before the fire and smiled at it as
he went on.
</P>

<P>
"'Will the sea drown the Marsh?" she says.  She was a Marsh woman first
an' foremost.
</P>

<P>
"'No," says the liddle voice.  "Sleep sound for all o' that."
</P>

<P>
"'Is the Plague comin' to the Marsh?" she says.  Them was all the ills
she knowed.
</P>

<P>
"'No.  Sleep sound for all o' that," says Robin.
</P>

<P>
'She turned about, half mindful to go in, but the liddle voices grieved
that shrill an' sorrowful she turns back, an' she cries:  "If it is not
a Trouble of Flesh an' Blood, what can I do?" 'The Pharisees cried out
upon her from all round to fetch them a boat to sail to France, an'
come back no more.
</P>

<P>
"'There's a boat on the Wall," she says, "but I can't push it down to
the sea, nor sail it when 'tis there."
</P>

<P>
"'Lend us your sons," says all the Pharisees.  "Give 'em Leave an'
Good-will to sail it for us, Mother&mdash;O Mother!"
</P>

<P>
"'One's dumb, an' t'other's blind," she says.  "But all the dearer me
for that; and you'll lose them in the big sea." The voices just about
pierced through her; an' there was children's voices too.  She stood
out all she could, but she couldn't rightly stand against that.  So she
says:  "If you can draw my sons for your job, I'D not hinder 'em.  You
can't ask no more of a Mother."
</P>

<P>
'She saw them liddle green lights dance an' cross till she was dizzy;
she heard them liddle feet patterin' by the thousand; she heard cruel
Canterbury Bells ringing to Bulverhithe, an' she heard the great
Tide-wave ranging along the Wall.  That was while the Pharisees was
workin' a Dream to wake her two sons asleep:  an' while she bit on her
fingers she saw them two she'd bore come out an' pass her with never a
word.  She followed 'em, cryin' pitiful, to the old boat on the Wall,
an' that they took an' runned down to the sea.
</P>

<P>
'When they'd stepped mast an' sail the blind son speaks:  "Mother,
we're waitin' your Leave an' Good-will to take Them over."'
</P>

<P>
Tom Shoesmith threw back his head and half shut his eyes.
</P>

<P>
'Eh, me!' he said.  'She was a fine, valiant woman, the Widow Whitgift.
She stood twistin' the eends of her long hair over her fingers, an' she
shook like a poplar, makin' up her mind.  The Pharisees all about they
hushed their children from cryin' an' they waited dumb-still.  She was
all their dependence.  'Thout her Leave an' Good-will they could not
pass; for she was the Mother.  So she shook like a aps-tree makin' up
her mind.  'Last she drives the word past her teeth, an' "Go!" she
says.  "Go with my Leave an' Goodwill."
</P>

<P>
'Then I saw&mdash;then, they say, she had to brace back same as if she was
wadin' in tide-water; for the Pharisees just about flowed past
her&mdash;down the beach to the boat, I dunnamany of 'em&mdash;with their wives
an' childern an' valooables, all escapin' out of cruel Old England.
Silver you could hear chinkin', an' liddle bundles hove down dunt on
the bottom-boards, an' passels o' liddle swords an' shields raklin',
an' liddle fingers an' toes scratchin' on the boatside to board her
when the two sons pushed her off.  That boat she sunk lower an' lower,
but all the Widow could see in it was her boys movin' hampered-like to
get at the tackle.  Up sail they did, an' away they went, deep as a Rye
barge, away into the off-shore mists, an' the Widow Whitgift she sat
down an' eased her grief till mornin' light.'
</P>

<P>
'I never heard she was all alone,' said Hobden.
</P>

<P>
'I remember now.  The one called Robin, he stayed with her, they tell.
She was all too grieevious to listen to his promises.'
</P>

<P>
'Ah!  She should ha' made her bargain beforehand.  I allus told my
woman so!'Hobden cried.
</P>

<P>
'No.  She loaned her sons for a pure love-loan, bein' as she sensed the
Trouble on the Marshes, an' was simple good-willin' to ease it.'  Tom
laughed softly.  'She done that.  Yes, she done that!  From Hithe to
Bulverhithe, fretty man an' maid, ailin' woman an' wailin' child, they
took the advantage of the change in the thin airs just about as soon as
the Pharisees flitted.  Folks come out fresh an' shinin' all over the
Marsh like snails after wet.  An' that while the Widow Whitgift sat
grievin' on the Wall.  She might have belieft us&mdash;she might have
trusted her sons would be sent back!  She fussed, no bounds, when their
boat come in after three days.'
</P>

<P>
'And, of course, the sons were both quite cured?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'No-o.  That would have been out o' nature.  She got 'em back as she
sent 'em.  The blind man he hadn't seen naught of anythin', an' the
dumb man nature-ally he couldn't say aught of what he'd seen.  I reckon
that was why the Pharisees pitched on 'em for the ferryin' job.' 'But
what did you&mdash;what did Robin promise the Widow?' said Dan.
</P>

<P>
'What did he promise, now?'  Tom pretended to think. 'Wasn't your woman
a Whitgift, Ralph?  Didn't she ever say?'
</P>

<P>
'She told me a passel o' no-sense stuff when he was born.'  Hobden
pointed at his son.  'There was always to be one of 'em that could see
further into a millstone than most.'
</P>

<P>
'Me!  That's me!'said the Bee Boy so suddenly that they all laughed.
</P>

<P>
'I've got it now!' cried Tom, slapping his knee.  'So long as Whitgift
blood lasted, Robin promised there would allers be one o' her stock
that&mdash;that no Trouble 'ud lie on, no Maid 'ud sigh on, no Night could
frighten, no Fright could harm, no Harm could make sin, an' no Woman
could make a fool of.'
</P>

<P>
'Well, ain't that just me?' said the Bee Boy, where he sat in the
silver square of the great September moon that was staring into the
oast-house door.
</P>

'They was the exact words she told me when we first found he wasn't
like others.  But it beats me how you known 'em,' said Hobden.
</P>

<P>
'Aha!  There's more under my hat besides hair?'  Tom laughed and
stretched himself.  'When I've seen these two young folk home, we'll
make a night of old days, Ralph, with passin' old tales&mdash;eh?  An' where
might you live?' he said, gravely, to Dan.  'An' do you think your Pa
'ud give me a drink for takin' you there, Missy?'
</P>

<P>
They giggled so at this that they had to run out.  Tom picked them both
up, set one on each broad shoulder, and tramped across the ferny
pasture where the cows puffed milky puffs at them in the moonlight.
</P>

<P>
'Oh, Puck!  Puck!  I guessed you right from when you talked about the
salt.  How could you ever do it?' Una cried, swinging along delighted.
</P>

<P>
'Do what?'he said, and climbed the stile by the pollard oak.
</P>

<P>
'Pretend to be Tom Shoesmith,' said Dan, and they ducked to avoid the
two little ashes that grow by the bridge over the brook.  Tom was
almost running.
</P>

<P>
'Yes.  That's my name, Mus' Dan,' he said, hurrying over the silent
shining lawn, where a rabbit sat by the big white-thorn near the
croquet ground.  'Here you be.'  He strode into the old kitchen yard,
and slid them down as Ellen came to ask questions.
</P>

<P>
'I'm helping in Mus' Spray's oast-house,' he said to her.  'No, I'm no
foreigner.  I knowed this country 'fore your mother was born; an'&mdash;yes,
it's dry work oastin', Miss.  Thank you.'
</P>

<P>
Ellen went to get a jug, and the children went in&mdash;magicked once more
by Oak, Ash, and Thorn!

Now it was the third week in November, and the woods rang with the
noise of pheasant-shooting.  No one hunted that steep, cramped country
except the village beagles, who, as often as not, escaped from their
kennels and made a day of their own.  Dan and Una found a couple of
them towling round the kitchen-garden after the laundry cat.  The
little brutes were only too pleased to go rabbiting, so the children
ran them all along the brook pastures and into Little Lindens
farm-yard, where the old sow vanquished them&mdash;and up to the
quarry-hole, where they started a fox.  He headed for Far Wood, and
there they frightened out all the Pheasants, who were sheltering from a
big beat across the valley.  Then the cruel guns began again, and they
grabbed the beagles lest they should stray and get hurt.
</P>

<P>
'I wouldn't be a pheasant&mdash;in November&mdash;for a lot,' Dan panted, as he
caught Folly by the neck.  'Why did you laugh that horrid way?'
</P>

<P>
'I didn't,' said Una, sitting on Flora, the fat lady-dog. 'Oh, look!
The silly birds are going back to their own woods instead of ours,
where they would be safe.'
</P>

<P>
'Safe till it pleased you to kill them.'  An old man, so tall he was
almost a giant, stepped from behind the clump of hollies by Volaterrae.
The children jumped, and the dogs dropped like setters.  He wore a
sweeping gown of dark thick stuff, lined and edged with yellowish fur,
and he bowed a bent-down bow that made them feel both proud and
ashamed.  Then he looked at them steadily, and they stared back without
doubt or fear.
</P>

<P>
'You are not afraid?' he said, running his hands through his splendid
grey beard.  'Not afraid that those men yonder'&mdash;he jerked his head
towards the incessant POP-POP of the guns from the lower woods&mdash;'will
do you hurt?'
</P>

<P>
'We-ell'&mdash;Dan liked to be accurate, especially when he was shy&mdash;'old
Hobd&mdash;a friend of mine told me that one of the beaters got peppered
last week&mdash;hit in the leg, I mean.  You see, Mr Meyer will fire at
rabbits.  But he gave Waxy Garnett a quid&mdash;sovereign, I mean&mdash;and Waxy
told Hobden he'd have stood both barrels for half the money.'
</P>

<P>
'He doesn't understand,'Una cried, watching the pale, troubled face.
'Oh, I wish&mdash;'
</P>

<P>
She had scarcely said it when Puck rustled out of the hollies and spoke
to the man quickly in foreign words. Puck wore a long cloak too&mdash;the
afternoon was just frosting down&mdash;and it changed his appearance
altogether.
</P>

<P>
'Nay, nay!'he said at last.  'You did not understand the boy.  A
freeman was a little hurt, by pure mischance, at the hunting.'
</P>

<P>
'I know that mischance!  What did his lord do?  Laugh and ride over
him?' the old man sneered.
</P>

<P>
'It was one of your own people did the hurt, Kadmiel.' Puck's eyes
twinkled maliciously.  'So he gave the freeman a piece of gold, and no
more was said.'
</P>

<P>
'A Jew drew blood from a Christian and no more was said?' Kadmiel
cried.  'Never!  When did they torture him?'
</P>

<P>
'No man may be bound, or fined, or slain till he has been judged by his
peers,' Puck insisted.  'There is but one Law in Old England for Jew or
Christian&mdash;the Law that was signed at Runnymede.'
</P>

<P>
'Why, that's Magna Charta!' Dan whispered.  It was one of the few
history dates that he could remember.
</P>

<P>
Kadmiel turned on him with a sweep and a whirr of his spicy-scented
gown.
</P>

<P>
'Dost thou know of that, babe?' he cried, and lifted his hands in
wonder.
</P>

<P>
'Yes,' said Dan firmly.
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'Magna Charta was signed by John,<BR>
     That Henry the Third put his heel upon.<BR>
</P>

<P>
And old Hobden says that if it hadn't been for her (he calls everything
"her", you know), the keepers would have him clapped in Lewes jail all
the year round.'
</P>

<P>
Again Puck translated to Kadmiel in the strange, solemn-sounding
language, and at last Kadmiel laughed.
</P>

<P>
'Out of the mouths of babes do we learn,' said he.  'But tell me now,
and I will not call you a babe but a Rabbi, why did the King sign the
roll of the New Law at Runnymede? For he was a King.'
</P>

<P>
Dan looked sideways at his sister.  It was her turn.
</P>

<P>
'Because he jolly well had to,' said Una softly.  'The Barons made
him.' 'Nay,' Kadmiel answered, shaking his head.  'You Christians
always forget that gold does more than the sword.  Our good King signed
because he could not borrow more money from us bad Jews.'  He curved
his shoulders as he spoke.  'A King without gold is a snake with a
broken back, and'&mdash;his nose sneered up and his eyebrows frowned
down&mdash;'it is a good deed to break a snake's back.  That was my work,'
he cried, triumphantly, to Puck.  'Spirit of Earth, bear witness that
that was my work!'  He shot up to his full towering height, and his
words rang like a trumpet.  He had a voice that changed its tone almost
as an opal changes colour&mdash;sometimes deep and thundery, sometimes thin
and waily, but always it made you listen.
</P>

<P>
'Many people can bear witness to that,' Puck answered.  'Tell these
babes how it was done.  Remember, Master, they do not know Doubt or
Fear.'
</P>

<P>
'So I saw in their faces when we met,' said Kadmiel. 'Yet surely,
surely they are taught to spit upon Jews?'
</P>

<P>
'Are they?' said Dan, much interested.  'Where at?'
</P>

<P>
Puck fell back a pace, laughing.  'Kadmiel is thinking of King John's
reign,' he explained.  'His people were badly treated then.'
</P>

<P>
'Oh, we know that.'  they answered, and (it was very rude of them, but
they could not help it) they stared straight at Kadmiel's mouth to see
if his teeth were all there.  It stuck in their lesson-memory that King
John used to pull out Jews' teeth to make them lend him money.
</P>

<P>
Kadmiel understood the look and smiled bitterly.
</P>

<P>
'No.  Your King never drew my teeth:  I think, perhaps, I drew his.
Listen!  I was not born among Christians, but among Moors&mdash;in Spain&mdash;in
a little white town under the mountains.  Yes, the Moors are cruel, but
at least their learned men dare to think.  It was prophesied of me at
my birth that I should be a Lawgiver to a People of a strange speech
and a hard language.  We Jews are always looking for the Prince and the
Lawgiver to come.  Why not?  My people in the town (we were very few)
set me apart as a child of the prophecy&mdash;the Chosen of the Chosen.  We
Jews dream so many dreams.  You would never guess it to see us slink
about the rubbish-heaps in our quarter; but at the day's end&mdash;doors
shut, candles lit&mdash;aha!  then we became the Chosen again.'
</P>

<P>
He paced back and forth through the wood as he talked.  The rattle of
the shot-guns never ceased, and the dogs whimpered a little and lay
flat on the leaves. 'I was a Prince.  Yes!  Think of a little Prince
who had never known rough words in his own house handed over to
shouting, bearded Rabbis, who pulled his ears and filliped his nose,
all that he might learn&mdash;learn&mdash;learn to be King when his time came.
He!  Such a little Prince it was!  One eye he kept on the
stone-throwing Moorish boys, and the other it roved about the streets
looking for his Kingdom.  Yes, and he learned to cry softly when he was
hunted up and down those streets.  He learned to do all things without
noise.  He played beneath his father's table when the Great Candle was
lit, and he listened as children listen to the talk of his father's
friends above the table.  They came across the mountains, from out of
all the world, for my Prince's father was their counsellor.  They came
from behind the armies of Sala-ud-Din:  from Rome:  from Venice:  from
England.  They stole down our alley, they tapped secretly at our door,
they took off their rags, they arrayed themselves, and they talked to
my father at the wine.  All over the world the heathen fought each
other.  They brought news of these wars, and while he played beneath
the table, my Prince heard these meanly dressed ones decide between
themselves how, and when, and for how long King should draw sword
against King, and People rise up against People.  Why not?  There can
be no war without gold, and we Jews know how the earth's gold moves
with the seasons, and the crops, and the winds; circling and looping
and rising and sinking away like a river&mdash;a wonderful underground
river.  How should the foolish Kings know that while they fight and
steal and kill?'
</P>

<P>
The children's faces showed that they knew nothing at all as, with open
eyes, they trotted and turned beside the long-striding old man.  He
twitched his gown over his shoulders, and a square plate of gold,
studded with jewels, gleamed for an instant through the fur, like a
star through flying snow.
</P>

<P>
'No matter,' he said.  'But, credit me, my Prince saw peace or war
decided not once, but many times, by the fall of a coin spun between a
Jew from Bury and a Jewess from Alexandria, in his father's house, when
the Great Candle was lit.  Such power had we Jews among the Gentiles.
Ah, my little Prince!  Do you wonder that he learned quickly?  Why
not?'  He muttered to himself and went on:
</P>

<P>
'My trade was that of a physician.  When I had learned it in Spain I
went to the East to find my Kingdom.  Why not?  A Jew is as free as a
sparrow&mdash;or a dog.  He goes where he is hunted.  In the East I found
libraries where men dared to think&mdash;schools of medicine where they
dared to learn.  I was diligent in my business.  Therefore I stood
before Kings.  I have been a brother to Princes and a companion to
beggars, and I have walked between the living and the dead.  There was
no profit in it.  I did not find my Kingdom.  So, in the tenth year of
my travels, when I had reached the Uttermost Eastern Sea, I returned to
my father's house.  God had wonderfully preserved my people.  None had
been slain, none even wounded, and only a few scourged.  I became once
more a son in my father's house.  Again the Great Candle was lit; again
the meanly apparelled ones tapped on our door after dusk; and again I
heard them weigh out peace and war, as they weighed out the gold on the
table.  But I was not rich&mdash;not very rich.  Therefore, when those that
had power and knowledge and wealth talked together, I sat in the
shadow.  Why not?
</P>

<P>
'Yet all my wanderings had shown me one sure thing, which is, that a
King without money is like a spear without a head.  He cannot do much
harm.  I said, therefore, to Elias of Bury, a great one among our
people: "Why do our people lend any more to the Kings that oppress us?"
"Because," said Elias, "if we refuse they stir up their people against
us, and the People are tenfold more cruel than Kings.  If thou
doubtest, come with me to Bury in England and live as I live."
</P>

<P>
'I saw my mother's face across the candle flame, and I said, "I will
come with thee to Bury.  Maybe my Kingdom shall be there."
</P>

<P>
'So I sailed with Elias to the darkness and the cruelty of Bury in
England, where there are no learned men.  How can a man be wise if he
hate?  At Bury I kept his accounts for Elias, and I saw men kill Jews
there by the tower.  No&mdash;none laid hands on Elias.  He lent money to
the King, and the King's favour was about him.  A King will not take
the life so long as there is any gold.  This King&mdash;yes, John&mdash;oppressed
his people bitterly because they would not give him money.  Yet his
land was a good land.  If he had only given it rest he might have
cropped it as a Christian crops his beard.  But even that little he did
not know, for God had deprived him of all understanding, and had
multiplied pestilence, and famine, and despair upon the people.
Therefore his people turned against us Jews, who are all people's dogs.
Why not?  Lastly the Barons and the people rose together against the
King because of his cruelties.  Nay&mdash;nay&mdash;the Barons did not love the
people, but they saw that if the King cut up and destroyed the common
people, he would presently destroy the Barons.  They joined then, as
cats and pigs will join to slay a snake.  I kept the accounts, and I
watched all these things, for I remembered the Prophecy.
</P>

<P>
'A great gathering of Barons (to most of whom we had lent money) came
to Bury, and there, after much talk and a thousand runnings-about, they
made a roll of the New Laws that they would force on the King.  If he
swore to keep those Laws, they would allow him a little money. That was
the King's God&mdash;Money&mdash;to waste.  They showed us the roll of the New
Laws.  Why not?  We had lent them money.  We knew all their
counsels&mdash;we Jews shivering behind our doors in Bury.'  He threw out
his hands suddenly.  'We did not seek to be paid all in money. We
sought Power&mdash;Power&mdash;Power!  That is our God in our captivity.  Power
to use!
</P>

<P>
'I said to Elias:  "These New Laws are good.  Lend no more money to the
King:  so long as he has money he will lie and slay the people."
</P>

<P>
"'Nay," said Elias.  "I know this people.  They are madly cruel.
Better one King than a thousand butchers.  I have lent a little money
to the Barons, or they would torture us, but my most I will lend to the
King.  He hath promised me a place near him at Court, where my wife and
I shall be safe."
</P>

<P>
"'But if the King be made to keep these New Laws," I said, "the land
will have peace, and our trade will grow. If we lend he will fight
again."
</P>

<P>
"'Who made thee a Lawgiver in England?" said Elias. "I know this
people.  Let the dogs tear one another!  I will lend the King ten
thousand pieces of gold, and he can fight the Barons at his pleasure."
</P>

<P>
"'There are not two thousand pieces of gold in all England this
summer," I said, for I kept the accounts, and I knew how the earth's
gold moved&mdash;that wonderful underground river.  Elias barred home the
windows, and, his hands about his mouth, he told me how, when he was
trading with small wares in a French ship, he had come to the Castle of
Pevensey.'
</P>

<P>
'Oh!' said Dan.  'Pevensey again!' and looked at Una, who nodded and
skipped.
</P>

<P>
'There, after they had scattered his pack up and down the Great Hall,
some young knights carried him to an upper room, and dropped him into a
well in a wall, that rose and fell with the tide.  They called him
Joseph, and threw torches at his wet head.  Why not?'
</P>

<P>
'Why, of course!'cried Dan.  'Didn't you know it was&mdash;' Puck held up
his hand to stop him, and Kadmiel, who never noticed, went on.
</P>

<P>
'When the tide dropped he thought he stood on old armour, but feeling
with his toes, he raked up bar on bar of soft gold.  Some wicked
treasure of the old days put away, and the secret cut off by the sword.
I have heard the like before.'
</P>

<P>
'So have we,' Una whispered.  'But it wasn't wicked a bit.'
</P>

<P>
'Elias took a little of the stuff with him, and thrice yearly he would
return to Pevensey as a chapman, selling at no price or profit, till
they suffered him to sleep in the empty room, where he would plumb and
grope, and steal away a few bars.  The great store of it still
remained, and by long brooding he had come to look on it as his own.
Yet when we thought how we should lift and convey it, we saw no way.
This was before the Word of the Lord had come to me.  A walled fortress
possessed by Normans; in the midst a forty-foot tide-well out of which
to remove secretly many horse-loads of gold! Hopeless!  So Elias wept.
Adah, his wife, wept too.  She had hoped to stand beside the Queen's
Christian tiring-maids at Court when the King should give them that
place at Court which he had promised. Why not?  She was born in
England&mdash;an odious woman.
</P>

<P>
'The present evil to us was that Elias, out of his strong folly, had,
as it were, promised the King that he would arm him with more gold.
Wherefore the King in his camp stopped his ears against the Barons and
the people. Wherefore men died daily.  Adah so desired her place at
Court, she besought Elias to tell the King where the treasure lay, that
the King might take it by force, and&mdash;they would trust in his
gratitude.  Why not?  This Elias refused to do, for he looked on the
gold as his own.  They quarrelled, and they wept at the evening meal,
and late in the night came one Langton&mdash;a priest, almost learned&mdash;to
borrow more money for the Barons.  Elias and Adah went to their
chamber.'
</P>

<P>
Kadmiel laughed scornfully in his beard.  The shots across the valley
stopped as the shooting party changed their ground for the last beat.
</P>

<P>
'So it was I, not Elias,' he went on quietly, 'that made terms with
Langton touching the fortieth of the New Laws.'
</P>

<P>
'What terms?' said Puck quickly.  'The Fortieth of the Great Charter
says:  "To none will we sell, refuse, or delay right or justice."'
</P>

<P>
'True, but the Barons had written first:  To no free man.  It cost me
two hundred broad pieces of gold to change those narrow words.
Langton, the priest, understood. "Jew though thou art," said he, "the
change is just, and if ever Christian and Jew came to be equal in
England thy people may thank thee." Then he went out stealthily, as men
do who deal with Israel by night.  I think he spent my gift upon his
altar.  Why not?  I have spoken with Langton. He was such a man as I
might have been if&mdash;if we Jews had been a people.  But yet, in many
things, a child.
</P>

<P>
'I heard Elias and Adah abovestairs quarrel, and, knowing the woman was
the stronger, I saw that Elias would tell the King of the gold and that
the King would continue in his stubbornness.  Therefore I saw that the
gold must be put away from the reach of any man.  Of a sudden, the Word
of the Lord came to me saying, "The Morning is come, O thou that
dwellest in the land."'
</P>

<P>
Kadmiel halted, all black against the pale green sky beyond the wood&mdash;a
huge robed figure, like the Moses in the picture-Bible. 'I rose.  I
went out, and as I shut the door on that House of Foolishness, the
woman looked from the window and whispered, "I have prevailed on my
husband to tell the King!" I answered:  "There is no need.  The Lord is
with me."
</P>

<P>
'In that hour the Lord gave me full understanding of all that I must
do; and His Hand covered me in my ways. First I went to London, to a
physician of our people, who sold me certain drugs that I needed.  You
shall see why. Thence I went swiftly to Pevensey.  Men fought all
around me, for there were neither rulers nor judges in the abominable
land.  Yet when I walked by them they cried out that I was one
Ahasuerus, a Jew, condemned, as they believe, to live for ever, and
they fled from me every-ways.  Thus the Lord saved me for my work, and
at Pevensey I bought me a little boat and moored it on the mud beneath
the Marsh-gate of the Castle.  That also God showed me.'
</P>

<P>
He was as calm as though he were speaking of some stranger, and his
voice filled the little bare wood with rolling music.
</P>

<P>
'I cast'&mdash;his hand went to his breast, and again the strange jewel
gleamed&mdash;'I cast the drugs which I had prepared into the common well of
the Castle.  Nay, I did no harm.  The more we physicians know, the less
do we do.  Only the fool says:  "I dare." I caused a blotched and
itching rash to break out upon their skins, but I knew it would fade in
fifteen days.  I did not stretch out my hand against their life.  They
in the Castle thought it was the Plague, and they ran out, taking with
them their very dogs.
</P>

<P>
'A Christian physician, seeing that I was a Jew and a stranger, vowed
that I had brought the sickness from London.  This is the one time I
have ever heard a Christian leech speak truth of any disease.
Thereupon the people beat me, but a merciful woman said:  "Do not kill
him now.  Push him into our Castle with his Plague, and if, as he says,
it will abate on the fifteenth day, we can kill him then." Why not?
They drove me across the drawbridge of the Castle, and fled back to
their booths.  Thus I came to be alone with the treasure.'
</P>

<P>
'But did you know this was all going to happen just right?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'My Prophecy was that I should be a Lawgiver to a People of a strange
land and a hard speech.  I knew I should not die.  I washed my cuts.  I
found the tide-well in the wall, and from Sabbath to Sabbath I dove and
dug there in that empty, Christian-smelling fortress.  He!  I spoiled
the Egyptians!  He!  If they had only known!  I drew up many good loads
of gold, which I loaded by night into my boat.  There had been gold
dust too, but that had been washed out by the tides.'
</P>

<P>
'Didn't you ever wonder who had put it there?' said Dan, stealing a
glance at Puck's calm, dark face under the hood of his gown.  Puck
shook his head and pursed his lips.
</P>

<P>
'Often; for the gold was new to me,' Kadmiel replied.  'I know the
Golds.  I can judge them in the dark; but this was heavier and redder
than any we deal in.  Perhaps it was the very gold of Parvaim.  Eh, why
not?  It went to my heart to heave it on to the mud, but I saw well
that if the evil thing remained, or if even the hope of finding it
remained, the King would not sign the New Laws, and the land would
perish.'
</P>

<P>
'Oh, Marvel!' said Puck, beneath his breath, rustling in the dead
leaves.
</P>

<P>
'When the boat was loaded I washed my hands seven times, and pared
beneath my nails, for I would not keep one grain.  I went out by the
little gate where the Castle's refuse is thrown.  I dared not hoist
sail lest men should see me; but the Lord commanded the tide to bear me
carefully, and I was far from land before the morning.'
</P>

<P>
'Weren't you afraid?' said Una.
</P>

<P>
'Why?  There were no Christians in the boat.  At sunrise I made my
prayer, and cast the gold&mdash;all&mdash;all that gold&mdash;into the deep sea!  A
King's ransom&mdash;no, the ransom of a People!  When I had loosed hold of
the last bar, the Lord commanded the tide to return me to a haven at
the mouth of a river, and thence I walked across a wilderness to Lewes,
where I have brethren.  They opened the door to me, and they say&mdash;I had
not eaten for two days&mdash;they say that I fell across the threshold,
crying:  "I have sunk an army with horsemen in the sea!"'
</P>

<P>
'But you hadn't,' said Una.  'Oh, yes!  I see!  You meant that King
John might have spent it on that?'
</P>

<P>
'Even so,' said Kadmiel.
</P>

<P>
The firing broke out again close behind them.  The pheasants poured
over the top of a belt of tall firs.  They could see young Mr Meyer, in
his new yellow gaiters, very busy and excited at the end of the line,
and they could hear the thud of the falling birds.
</P>

<P>
'But what did Elias of Bury do?' Puck demanded.  'He had promised money
to the King.'
</P>

<P>
Kadmiel smiled grimly.  'I sent him word from London that the Lord was
on my side.  When he heard that the Plague had broken out in Pevensey,
and that a Jew had been thrust into the Castle to cure it, he
understood my word was true.  He and Adah hurried to Lewes and asked me
for an accounting.  He still looked on the gold as his own.  I told
them where I had laid it, and I gave them full leave to pick it up...
Eh, well!  The curses of a fool and the dust of a journey are two
things no wise man can escape...  But I pitied Elias!  The King was
wroth with him because he could not lend; the Barons were wroth too
because they heard that he would have lent to the King; and Adah was
wroth with him because she was an odious woman.  They took ship from
Lewes to Spain. That was wise!'
</P>

<P>
'And you?  Did you see the signing of the Law at Runnymede?' said Puck,
as Kadmiel laughed noiselessly.
</P>

<P>
'Nay.  Who am I to meddle with things too high for me? I returned to
Bury, and lent money on the autumn crops. Why not?'
</P>

<P>
There was a crackle overhead.  A cock-pheasant that had sheered aside
after being hit spattered down almost on top of them, driving up the
dry leaves like a shell.  Flora and Folly threw themselves at it; the
children rushed forward, and when they had beaten them off and smoothed
down the plumage Kadmiel had disappeared.
</P>

<P>
'Well,' said Puck calmly, 'what did you think of it? Weland gave the
Sword!  The Sword gave the Treasure, and the Treasure gave the Law.
It's as natural as an oak growing.'
</P>

<P>
'I don't understand.  Didn't he know it was Sir Richard's old
treasure?' said Dan.  'And why did Sir Richard and Brother Hugh leave
it lying about?  And&mdash;and&mdash;'
</P>

<P>
'Never mind,' said Una politely.  'He'll let us come and go and look
and know another time.  Won't you, Puck?' 'Another time maybe,' Puck
answered.  'Brr!  It's cold&mdash;and late.  I'll race you towards home!'
</P>

<P>
They hurried down into the sheltered valley.  The sun had almost sunk
behind Cherry Clack, the trodden ground by the cattle-gates was
freezing at the edges, and the new-waked north wind blew the night on
them from over the hills.  They picked up their feet and flew across
the browned pastures, and when they halted, panting in the steam of
their own breath, the dead leaves whirled up behind them.  There was
Oak and Ash and Thorn enough in that year-end shower to magic away a
thousand memories.
</P>

<P>
So they trotted to the brook at the bottom of the lawn, wondering why
Flora and Folly had missed the quarry-hole fox.
</P>

<P>
Old Hobden was just finishing some hedge-work. They saw his white smock
glimmer in the twilight where he faggoted the rubbish.
</P>

<P>
'Winter, he's come, I reckon, Mus' Dan,' he called. 'Hard times now
till Heffle Cuckoo Fair.  Yes, we'll all be glad to see the Old Woman
let the Cuckoo out o' the basket for to start lawful Spring in England.'
</P>

<P>
They heard a crash, and a stamp and a splash of water as though a heavy
old cow were crossing almost under their noses.
</P>

<P>
Hobden ran forward angrily to the ford.
</P>

<P>
'Gleason's bull again, playin' Robin all over the Farm! Oh, look, Mus'
Dan&mdash;his great footmark as big as a trencher.  No bounds to his
impidence!  He might count himself to be a man or&mdash;or Somebody&mdash;'
</P>

<P>
A voice the other side of the brook boomed:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
     'I wonder who his cloak would turn<BR>
     When Puck had led him round,<BR>
     Or where those walking fires would burn&mdash;'<BR>
</P>

<P>
Then the children went in singing 'Farewell, Rewards and Fairies' at
the tops of their voices.  They had forgotten that they had not even
said good-night to Puck.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
